			<p>Just as a guillotine has brought many a royal line to termination, so also does Blade Guillotine for the Lovely Hearts. 
			A ruthless opponent, Blade seeks and destroys the Hearts in a relentless fashion, her mere appearance being enough to tip 
			an even balance and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

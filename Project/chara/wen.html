			Character Bio/Personality:  
			To meet Wentea is to come away with the perception of a cool collected person, but that's a huge facade. 
			In truth, she's a bit of a space cadet and even more aloof than Kayre and J&iacute; Li&aacute;n. 
			Wentea is internationally known, having found a successful career as a fashion model. She also has a clothing line. 
			For someone so well known and widely regarded, precious little is known about her save these scant facts: 
			Wentea is originally from the Tribal Lands of Vagor, where her family still lives and she's been out of touch with them for a number of years. 
			There are rumors that Wentea isn't even her real name. </p>

			Character Bio/Personality:  
			F&uacute; c&igrave; lost her entire family in the Ti&#257;nsh&agrave;ng massacre and was on the run from the assassins before one of the Starlit 7th found her. 
			They took her in and took care of her such that she wanted for nothing, yet the memories of loss still haunt her and sadness is never far from her eyes. 
			Later, they dropped her off on J&iacute; Li&aacute;n's doorstep, as they wanted her to gain a more "normal" lifestyle. 
			F&uacute; c&igrave; is a melancholy little girl and is always a touch sad with a little bit of stressed, but never to the point of an all out panic.</p>

			Character Bio/Personality:  
			Riasa is a hot blooded adrenaline junkie. She's always looking for her next high, a trait that her parents had 
			hoped she would have grown out of by her teens. Despite being only 15, Riasa has displayed an astonishing competency for 
			all sorts of vehicles, be it one that hovers, flies, floats, rides or drives. Unfortunately, her skill in vehicular control 
			doesn't translate to an understanding of legalities, so where most young debutantes would have a team of bodyguards to protect 
			them, Riasa has a team of lawyers. She also collects martial arts styles and adapts them to fit her ability to freely fly. </p>

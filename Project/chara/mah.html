			Character Bio/Personality:  
			Mahana has one of the highest levels of raw magical potential of anyone alive. 
			She's also very naive and trusting, not difficult to trick, and she lacks confidence in her abilities. 
			Despite that, she's extremely cheerful and doesn't dwell long on failure. 
			Mahana is a dead ringer for the missing Pyara and has memory loss, which makes Odisse think she is Pyara.</p>

			Character Bio/Personality: 
			Daeon is above all else professional. He has a keen analytic mind, sharpened by years of maintaining a staggering dominance in his 
			classes at the cost of his eyesight, requiring the use of glasses. Daeon has successfully transitioned his mental capabilities to 
			financial gain and has, at the young age of 19, become one of the wealthiest people in his country. Daeon is a cold individual: 
			he doesn't smile, he doesn't raise his voice, and he constantly looks for the dark lining to any silver clouds. He keeps his dark 
			hair slicked back, so people tend to be surprised when they find out how long it actually is.</p>

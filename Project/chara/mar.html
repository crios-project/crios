			Character Bio/Personality: 
			Marate is extremely charismatic and gregarious. People love him and he loves people. 
			He cares for a group of orphans and raises them with as much love as he would his own children. 
			Marate is incredibly savvy of world events, keeping tabs on the plans of all the various factions.  
			<br><br>
			Marate has overwhelming strength and power. He tends to use physical weapons like brass knuckles or, more often, his fists, but is a weapon master. 
			He will make a fight as fair as possible even if that fighting them heavily handicapped, this insistence on fairness being the cause of the majority of his scars.  </p>

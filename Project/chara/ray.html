			Character Bio/Personality:  
			Rayen is a bit of a girly girl, but she approaches everything with professionalism. 
			This has a result of making interactions with her a bit curt and to the point, much unlike her sister Aisu. 
			While her twin is a genius in mechanics, Rayen is a genius in technology and planning, always able to see the flaw in a plan. 
			She designed the comms the Lovely Hearts relied on during missions. She's persnickety to the point of using half years in her age.</p>

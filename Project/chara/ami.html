			Character Bio/Personality: 
			While she’s still a mischievous scamp in her heart, Ami’s more commonly seen as a fashionista nowadays. 
			She is always stylish and projects perfection naturally; she doesn’t really particularly try to look good. 
			It’s because of this and her easygoing good nature that people tend to flock to her... 
			and are always so stunned when they find themselves on the end of one of her devious (but never harmful) pranks.</p>

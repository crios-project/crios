			Character Bio/Personality:  
			While Tiala is still serious, she's mellowed significantly over her younger self. 
			Her perspective has similarly become more bitter sweet; she knows she can't do everything 
			herself and sacrifices will be made, but she's no longer so devoted to her cause that she's willing to forfeit them for victory.</p>

          <p>The origins of the Final War can be traced back to the extremist terrorist attack and destruction of the Primary Space Station which resulted in a devastating rain of debris on the Australian continent. With the attackers remaining unknown, there was a mutual consent among world governments who funded space programs to quietly shut down and refocus effort on other branches of science. While many of the scientists and professionals moved to the private sector when government funding dried up, enough remained and/or were willing to shift their focus to a new branch of research and innovation. That focus? The earth itself. After thorough analysis of land and sky, a concerted effort was made to fully explore the wide ranging seas. This focus would last for a few decades, but as all things eventually are it was eventually completed. The major scientific focus moved inward once more; after having turned from space to the planet, it shifted from the planet to humanity itself. More specifically, the focus turned to the capabilities and abilities of the mind.</p>
<p>The ensuing research yielded many minor discoveries (some of which we still see to this day) but it yielded two major discoveries that in a most literal sense changed the world. This historian has no doubt that every reader has already guessed what these innovations are, but for the sake of posterity they will be stated here. The first was the existence of a collective subconscious that connects all of humanity together, which would later be come to known as the Global Collective Subconscious or GCSC for short. Many historical politicians and cult leaders who maintained near universal approval from or massive sway over their respective audience or followers are thought to have actually been tapping into the collective subconscious to gather people to themselves. The collective subconscious is also the likely cause of people maintaining what was known as a "mob mentality", where entire groups of people act in concert with each other as though controlled by a single mind. </p>
<p>The actual discovery of the collective subconscious is disputed: some saying it was discovered by Dr. Arista Suri via meditation break from other research while others believe some American scientist noticed unusual behavior and interactions which observed patients addicted to opiates. The most commonly accepted answer (and the one this historian believes most likely is that English biologist Dr. Calvin Severan was the true discoverer of the collective subconscious. As the story goes, Dr. Severan was asked by his young daughter about how it was that sometimes you can instinctively know that someone you love is in trouble, in spite of not actually being in contact with said person. He admitted not knowing but decided to humor his daughter and spend the last hour or so at work the next day doing a bit of real research into the concept. He ended up spending five hours that day including three unpaid and the entirety of the next day looking into it. An innocent question from a child led to the discovery of a latent psychic connection that connected all of humanity, one to another.</p> 
<p>The first discovery led to an equally important second: building off the discovery of and research into the collective subconscious, Doctor Chandan Charu found evidence of the ability to effect reality itself via manifesting one's will.This is, of course, referring to ESP or as it is known more colloquially, Magic. In the past, one might see manifested will in occurrences which could not be recreated later, such as when a mother would lift a car off of their trapped child or more frequently, when things that have an infinitesimally low probability of happening happen like hitting a jackpot multiple times in one sitting or winning a lottery with a single ticket the first time entering. In any given situation where there is a desperate need or want for an event to happen a certain way, humanity can impose their will on reality and bend it to their purposes.</p>
<p>Research into both the collective subconscious and the extrasensory power were hampered for years by the same issue: a fundamental lack of data. More specifically, there weren't enough people able to tap into the subconscious nor enough people able to use ESP. The few subjects that could tap into the subconscious were found were only barely able to connect (it was typical to only find the ability in twins, triplets, quadruplets, etc.) and when connected only capable of sending emotions and other less quantifiable data, while the espers (which frequently were actually charlatans trying to deceive) were only able to bend spoons and move pencils. In essence, nice parlor tricks but nothing truly impressive. This was of course before the Cailsas Family was discovered.</p>
<p>The Cailsas family was a four person family with unprecedented skill with the collective subconscious and a number of different extrasensory powers. Not only was each member of the the family able to sense each one of the other's feelings, they were able to pass messages and even coordinate physically as though through a shared mind. Each member also possessed dramatic extrasensory powers including pyrokinesis, telekinesis, hydrokinesis, and terrakinesis. As they were found, international scientists made dramatic strides with their research, being able to confirm and debunk a number of theories including the much supported genetic disposition theory, as the family had adopted both children and had no blood ties to each other. It wasn't very long until the scientists found a possible cause for the family's prodigious abilities. They had recently taken a trip to a certain country in North Africa.</p>
          <h1 class="title hello">The War of Three Fronts - Prelude to the Final War</h1>
<p>With the revelation that the collective subconscious and extrasensory power could be enhanced and induced via some of that particular country's flora, naturally the scientific community as a whole wanted to have more samples for research and study. The requests for the plants were all unequivocally denied. When pushed for the reason for such a flat refusal, the African country cited that the plants had a religious significance to their culture and was not permitted to be taken from the country. Of course, the follow up request was to allow scientist in to study the plants and see if they could possibly replicate the effects, but again a refusal was made. The country had heavy travel restrictions due to previous problems with tourists and visitors. As a sovereign nation, the other countries were supposed to accede to the African nation's request to be left alone, but dreams of ESP powered psychically connected super soldiers danced in many a government official's head and no less than three European nations attempted to circumvent them. One attempted to smuggle its scientists in as refugees (they were immediately caught), another tried to recruit residents of the country to collect the plants for them (no one would take the bribe), and one country took a rather desperate gamble of sending a black ops team to infiltrate and "liberate" the assets. That last one went especially poorly and not only was the team caught, they were imprisoned and refused release.</p>
<p>The European country was incensed at being publicly shamed by this "tiny little backwater third world country" and in their rash stung pride sent their military forces to show the country how things were going to be. Due to the previous adamant refusal to even allow scientists in the country to study the plants, much of the world's powers turned a blind eye to this blatant violation of the nation's rights as they too wanted the plant for study. Little did they know or expect that the "tiny little backwater third world country" was not only allied with the other nations in a sweeping African alliance, but it was also a great world power unto itself. Those ESP powered psychically connected super soldiers that the other world powers had dreamed of already existed and they were vast in number. The attacking country's military was utterly annihilated and the African Alliance took this as the moment to pay back centuries of injustice perpetuated on them and their diaspora. The unified African force swept through Europe, starting with the offending country and quickly spread to the surrounding countries. In a number of days, Europe fell.</p>
<p>The United States of America was at this time still one of the staunchest allies of a number of European nations and while they were willing to allow the invasion of the North African country to get the plants, they were must less okay with the retribution being visited upon the European invaders. However, ressentiment had long been simmering among the oppressed minorities in the country with the Latino and Indigenous communities getting the brunt of it. While the U.S.A. marched off to war, key members in high government positions toppled many of the pillars that sustained the American edifice and the country fractured entirely in a silent home grown insurgency. Shortly after, South American interests joined with the new rulers of the former country to form one united America across two continents. Canada was more than happy to integrate themselves with the new superpower.</p>
<p>With America united and Europe subsumed, the uneasy alliance of the Asian continent decided they must truly unite in the face of this unknown novel threat. Starting with a marriage between the Chinese Dragon Throne and the Japanese Chrysanthemum Throne, the Asian nations allied one with another to strengthen themselves for what was coming next (excepting the Russian nations which were summarily conquered in a skirmish so quick, most historians won't even deign to call it a war). With tensions rising, the players were in place and the stage was finally set for the Final War.</p>
	<h1 class="title hello">The Final War</h1>
<p>The uprising and conquer of Europe by the African Alliance unsettled the new Asian and American superpowers, so much so that the Asian superpower immediately tried to launch a preemptive strike to break the African superpower. The first strike was a bloody affair with both sides evenly matched: while the Asian powers had an absolute terrifying number of people to commit to the fight, the African elites were capable of decimating their foes. Yet, they were not able to field many of thier elites in combat, as they were also having to put down revolutions and insurgencies from within their European holdings with those same elites. They were fighting a war on two fronts which eventually became a war on three fronts as America joined the fray. While untold centuries of military spending had made the U.S. the very forefront of the weapons of war, that advantage was greatly mitigated by the uncanniness of the African elites, whose powers were such as the be able to disarm even nuclear ordinance with their mind. And even though America had joined the war, by no means were they the ally of the Asian superpower. America's stance was that the only ones who could be trusted to use the powers responsibly was themselves.</p>
<p>The entire world was at war with itself to a degree that that had never been seen before. Not only were the powers fights among themselves, the powers had fighting within themselves. The conquered Europeans tried and failed regularly to unshackle themselves from the African revenge that was playing out. The American alliance was in turmoil due to the staggering number of various governments that were trying to work together. Even the Asian powers had some issues with each country doing their best to position themselves to take the lead in whatever type of government the alliance ended up becoming in the end. And naturally, each country involved in the conflict tried to subtly sabotage both enemy and ally to try to ensure that win or lose, they ended up on top. The conflict continued on for years, becoming the longest ongoing conflict in verified history with all parties locking in stalemate. America would bomb Asia, so Asia would give ground that Africa would claim. With African forces now spread thin, the Europeans would attempt to mount an insurrection, which would cause Africa to draw back to deal with it. America would try to claim a foothold but be forced to withdraw when Asia or Africa would strike directly at the heart of the American powers. For an age, the conflict continued: all sides suffering losses, all sides refusing to yield, and the conflict escalating with every passing cycle.</p>
<p>The carnage and brutality of the Final War was at its apex and would have likely crossed into the inhumane when the legendary Hero of Force arrived. This historian has not been anymore successful as their contemporaries in finding out any more details about the Hero of Force and the standard unknowns remain: their name, their race, their gender, even their country of origin remain a mystery. What this historian has discovered is that the Hero of Force was much taller than previously assumed with a stature that approached two meters and they had a "voice that commanded attention, even if you couldn't understand the language". No records exist with further details on the Hero of Force, nor do any that explain what they did precisely to end the Final War so decisively. But whatever they did was quite effective, as the gears of wars ground to a halt mere days after their first arrival and the Final War came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>In the ashes and aftermath of the war, the Hero of Force gathered together the leaders of each of the warring factions to what would become Capital City to discuss the way of the world going forward. Together, a plan was made to repair the damage wrought by the war and treaties were signed to prevent such a thing from happening again. The new world would be made up of three unified triunes each with their own culture and governing system. The Americas became the Tribal Kingdom of Vagor, a socialist monarchy lead by a Queen and that would oversee the majority of the world's food production. The Asian countries became the second triune, T&#335;ng&#299; K&#333;tei-f&#363;, an empire leading in research and innovation of technology with a strict social hierarchy ruled by an elected Emperor or Empress. The former African and European continents became the final triune of Sege Amant, a democracy ruled by a council of elders and the home of creatives and entertainers as well as the medical research that allowed access to the nootropics that triggered the war itself. With the war over and peace enforced by the Hero's Accord, the Hero of Force stepped into the pages of history, vanishing as mysteriously as they first appeared.</p>
          <h1 class="title hello">After the Final War</h1>
<p>With the Final War ended, Sege Amant led new research and study into the collective subconscious and the ability to manifest will. The Hero's Accord afforded the relaxation of the tensions that had predicated the wars and with collaborative effort, the chemicals responsible for both abilities were determined and synthetically replicated. Within a few decades, the entirety of the world populace had been treated with the drug and the ability to use magic had become commonplace in the world. This of course led directly into the Magic Manifested skirmishes, wherein fantastical beasts and races such as dragons, elves, vampires, and the like were created and unleashed in the world due to there being no mitigating or restraining factors from stopping anyone with power doing whatever they like with it. The skirmishes didn't die down for a number of years, though it should be noted as time continued to pass the probability of someone having both the power to create something as powerful as a dragon as well as the temperament to do so decreased, likely due to a natural suppression from the GCSC.</p>
<p>The research into the collective subconscious was not nearly so fraught with peril, as it was more akin to a new technology than a new source of power. As more and more of society consciously attuned to the collective subconscious, other technologies and forms of communication fell away and were replaced by it. The collective subconscious was eventually normalized as the Global Collective SubConscious and linked to an electronic interface, working much like the immersive reality Metaverse and pre AVR world wide web, save with brain computer interfaces instead of the more cumbersome hardware of the past. </p>
<p>For a thousand years after the Hero's Accord and the end of the Final War, the world maintained a mostly peaceful existence. Yet as with any lasting human structure, eventually cracks started to appear in the foundation. A technology tood longer than it should and a medical procedure couldn't go as planned. A critical food production somehow ended up not being made. A secret leaked. A person disappeared. Small cracks that would eventually bring the whole edifice down. Even so, all the cracks in the world couldn't have caused the unrestrained chaos and havoc  that Alulu Dike and Knivefall wreaked on the planet.</p>

### The Harmonic Magic System of Beeston
*Crios Project Canon*

----
## Overview

**Lúmenai** is a foundational magic system of the realm of Beeston.  
It is not spellcasting in the traditional sense, but **harmonic resonance**: magic arises when intent, emotion, and will align into a coherent *voice*.

Magic is **sung**, not spoken.  
Power is measured not by mana quantity, but by **harmonic stability** and **resonant authority**.

All Lúmenai manifestations are categorized by **Essentia**, structured into ascending harmonic strata known as **Tiers**.

---

## Fundamental Principles

- Lúmenai responds to **emotional truth**, not deception.
- Higher Tiers require **sustained resonance**, not quick casting.
- Power escalation increases:
  - Cognitive strain
  - Identity destabilization
  - Reality feedback
- No voice exists in isolation — resonance affects allies, enemies, and the realm itself.

---

## TIER 1 — BASIC ELEMENTS  
### *The Five Open Voices*

These are the foundational harmonic modes.  
All Lúmenai casters begin here.

---

### Éthera — Free / Nonelemental  
**Essence:** raw will, unshaped intent, magical breath

- Barriers
- Force projection
- Dispels

Éthera defines *control*, not power.

---

---

## TIER 2 — CONJOINED ELEMENTS

Entwinements are **simultaneous voicings**, not mixtures.  
Each forms a **new Essentia** with its own identity.

---

*(Pýrua + Áquora)*  
**Essence:** corrosive vitality

---

## SUPREMACIES  
### *High Harmonic Domains*

Supremacies override elemental logic.  
They **cannot** be fast-cast and require long-form resonance.

---

## TIER 3 — LÚMIRA  
### *Light / Holy / Healing*

**Essence:** restorative truth

Healing is **re-harmonization**, not repair.

**Common Effects**
- Healing
- Purification
- Revelation
- Oath-binding

Excessive use risks emotional collapse due to enforced truth.

---

## TIER 4 — ÓMURA  
### *Dark / Gravity / Collapse*

**Essence:** inevitability, absence, pull

Darkness is not evil — it is **weight and silence**.

**Common Effects**
- Gravity wells
- Void shaping
- Suppression fields
- Memory erasure

Extended exposure destabilizes identity and reality cohesion.

---

## TIER 5 — ÆÓNEL  
### *Neon Ultra / Infinity*

**Essence:** impossible continuation

Æónel **cannot** be sustained by a single voice.

**Common Effects**
- Reality recursion
- Infinite constructs
- Temporal loops
- Conceptual alteration

Most casters:
- Burn out
- Fragment
- Ascend
- Or erase themselves

---

## Harmonic Costs & Limits

| Tier | Risk Profile |
|----|----|
| Tier 1 | Emotional fatigue |
| Tier 2 | Identity strain |
| Tier 3 | Psychological fracture |
| Tier 4 | Reality feedback |
| Tier 5 | Existential failure |

---

## Narrative Notes

- Lúmenai is **not morally aligned**.
- Power reveals *truth* — it does not create it.
- The Lovely Hearts function as **harmonic ensembles**, amplifying each other.
- dissonant discord weaponizes **disharmony**, forcing Supremacy collapse.

---

## Continuity Flags

- Tier access is **story-gated**, not skill-gated.
- Supremacy use alters long-term character trajectories.
- Æónel usage permanently changes canon reality states.

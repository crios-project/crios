![[Tier 2 Metal - FiEa.png]]

**Metal** is a conjoined elemental force representing forged will, structural permanence, and weaponized stability. It is associated with craftsmanship, reinforcement, magnetic force, and technological expression. Within Lúmenai, Metal is an Entwinement expressing the transformation of raw material into intentional structure. In Cymora, Metal manifests through resonance that shapes density and sharpened solidity. Within the System of Royastella, Metal-aligned abilities exist primarily among external invaders, as conjoined elemental manifestations are canonically exclusive to hostile forces opposing the realm. Metal is forged will and sharpened solidity.

## Overview

| Magic System | Element Name | Classification | Core Expression |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Lúmenai | Férroma | Tier 2 — Vaelóri Entwinement | Forged will and sharpened structure |
| Cymora | Tândâr | Compound Element | Resonant density and weaponized solidity |
| System Mana | Conjoined Elemental Manifestation (Enemy Exclusive) | External Threat Discipline | Weaponized structural control and reinforced conquest tools |

## Lúmenai — Férroma

### Classification
Tier 2 — Conjoined Element  
Vaelóri Entwinement  
(Pýrua + Téroma)

### Essentia Profile
**Férroma** represents the harmonization of ignition and permanence. It embodies transformation through forging, where raw mass is shaped into deliberate form through force and heat. Unlike Earth, which emphasizes endurance and weight, Férroma focuses on refinement, edge creation, and intentional structural design.

Férroma practitioners frequently excel in defensive reinforcement and weapon manifestation.

### Magical Expression

Common manifestations include:

- Forged weapon and armor constructs  
- Reinforced barriers and structural stabilization  
- Magnetic field manipulation  
- Metallic terrain shaping  
- Precision reinforcement of allied constructs  

### Harmonic Behavior

Férroma requires careful balancing between Pýrua’s aggressive drive and Téroma’s stabilizing resistance. Excess ignition results in structural brittleness, while excessive stability suppresses shaping potential.

## Cymora — Tândâr

### Classification
Compound Elemental Root  
(Fire + Earth)

### Linguistic Role
**Tândâr** expresses Cymoran resonance through dense phonetic grounding combined with sharp ignition consonants. The incantation structure emphasizes stability followed by directed shaping bursts, mirroring the forging process.

### Sonic Properties

- Heavy, grounded vowel sustain  
- Forceful plosive consonants to represent structural shaping  
- Rhythmic hammer-like repetition patterns  
- Low-register resonance emphasizing density and permanence  

### Compound Cymoran Behavior

Tândâr is typically used in spells that:

- Generate weaponized constructs  
- Reinforce armor and fortifications  
- Manipulate magnetic or metallic structures  
- Bind or immobilize opponents through density amplification

## System Mana — Metal Manifestation

### Canon Classification
Enemy-Exclusive Conjoined Elemental Discipline

### Canon Note

Within Royastella, conjoined (Tier 2 equivalent) elemental expressions **do not naturally occur among native elemental cores**. These manifestations are associated exclusively with hostile external forces attempting territorial expansion into Royastella.

The **Runic Knights of Starlite 7th** are specifically tasked with defending the realm from these invaders, who frequently deploy advanced conjoined-element combat doctrines. These external aggressors are known to pursue expansion regardless of civilian or ecological destruction.

### Functional Nature

Metal manifestations in System combat are treated as advanced siege and warfare tools designed for conquest and environmental domination.

### Mechanical Properties

- Heavy weapon generation and reinforcement  
- Magnetic field combat manipulation  
- Adaptive armor growth  
- Terrain restructuring for battlefield control  
- Structural suppression of enemy defenses  

### Tactical Doctrine

Enemy Metal specialists often serve as:

- Frontline siege units  
- Defensive breachers  
- Battlefield architects  
- High-durability shock troops

## Comparative Analysis

### Philosophical Differences

| System | Metal Philosophy |
|----------|-------------|
| Lúmenai | Metal is intention made permanent through forging harmony |
| Cymora | Metal is density shaped by rhythmic resonance |
| System | Metal is conquest infrastructure and siege warfare |

### Casting Methodology

| System | Casting Mechanism |
|----------|-------------|
| Lúmenai | Dual harmonic forging through ignition and stabilization |
| Cymora | Dense phonetic resonance combined with rhythmic structural pulses |
| System | High-density mana conversion into structural weapon constructs |

### Structural Limitations

| System | Limitations |
|----------|-------------|
| Lúmenai | Requires harmonic equilibrium between aggression and stability |
| Cymora | Incantations require sustained vocal density and rhythmic precision |
| System | Metal constructs consume large quantities of mana and reduce mobility efficiency |

## Symbolism and Thematic Role

Across Crios cosmology, Metal commonly symbolizes:

- Discipline and refinement  
- Constructed identity and deliberate shaping  
- Industrialization and warfare infrastructure  
- Permanence versus adaptability  

Metal-aligned figures often represent themes of duty, endurance, and transformation through pressure or conflict.

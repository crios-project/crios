### The Spoken Magical Language of Nexsicon  
*Crios Project Canon*

---

## I. Overview

**Cymora** is the **verbal-only magical language of Nexsicon**, a reality-shaping system within the **Crios Project**.  
It is not a conventional spoken language but a **sonic interface**: words spoken in Cymora **perform magic rather than describe it**.

Cymora exists primarily as **sound, cadence, and resonance**. Written forms are approximations used for study, archival, and instruction.

---

## II. Design Philosophy

- **Spoken-first**: Cymora is meant to be *heard*, not read.
- **Sound = Function**: Phonetics influence magical output.
- **Flexible Grammar**: Ritual emphasis outweighs syntax.
- **Science-Fantasy Tone**: Mystical but clean; no pseudo-Latin clutter.
- **Chantable**: Built for breath, rhythm, and repetition.

---

## III. Linguistic Influences

Cymora draws from:
- **Welsh** — liquid consonants, breathy laterals, melodic flow
- **Gaelic** — rhythmic compounding, soft transitions
- **Arabic** — vowel resonance, incantatory weight

---

## IV. Phonetic System

### Vowels

| Letter | Sound |
|------|------|
| a | ah |
| e | eh |
| i | ee |
| o | oh |
| u | oo |

Vowels may be **elongated** during casting to sustain effects.

---

### Consonants

**Standard Consonants**  
b d f g h k l m n p r s t v w

**Special Consonants**
- **ll** → breathy Welsh lateral (“hl”)
- **ch** → throaty “loch” sound (rare, ritual-heavy)

---

### Stress Rules

- Stress falls on the **penultimate syllable**
- Single-syllable words are fully stressed

**Example**  
*Cymora* → **KIM-or-ah**

---

## V. Grammar Tendencies

Cymora favors **ritual clarity over rigid grammar**.

- Default order: **Subject – Verb – Object**
- Order may shift for emphasis or cadence
- Verbs often appear as **states or actions**, not tense-bound
- Modifiers usually **precede nouns**
- **Compounding** is the primary word-creation method

**Example**
- *Calon* (heart) + *Gwen* (light) → **Calonwen**

---

## VI. Magical Mechanics

Spoken Cymora reshapes reality through **resonant harmonics**.

Power is reinforced by:
- Rhythm (commonly **2–3–2** beats)
- Repetition
- Alliteration
- Vowel elongation

Some words act as **harmonic keys**, stabilizing or initializing magic rather than defining it.

---

## VII. Resonance Words

### Alulu
- **Pronunciation:** ah-LOO-loo
- **Function:** Soft awakening, stabilizing call
- **Usage:** Opening chants, attunement, summoning stabilization

Alulu is semantic-light and **resonance-heavy**.

## VIII. Elemental Root System

### Primary Elements

| Element             | Cymora Root    |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Fire                | **Tânor**      |
| Water               | **Nahr**       |
| Wind                | **Gwynt**      |
| Earth               | **Dâr**        |


---

### Compound Elements

| Element      | Cymora Root | Composition   |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| Ice          | Gwynahr     | Wind + Water  |
| Poison       | Tânahr      | Fire + Water  |
| Lightning    | Tângwynt    | Fire + Wind   |
| Metal        | Tândâr      | Fire + Earth  |
| Plant        | Nahdâr      | Water + Earth |
| Martial Arts | Gwyndâr     | Wind + Earth  |

Compound elements influence **phonetic structure and spell behavior**, not just meaning.

---

### Supreme Elements

| **Element** | **Cymora Root** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Light       | Alor            |
| Darkness    | Cythr           |
| Aether      | Aelwyr          |

## IX. Spellcasting Structure

Canonical spell format:

1. **English Spell Name** (external reference)
2. **Four-line Cymora incantation**

### Rules
- Spell names remain **English as headers**
- Spell names are **translated into Cymora within the incantation**
- Cymora spell-names must be:
  - Consistent
  - Compound-based
  - Chantable

---

## X. Naming Conventions

Names in Cymora emphasize **sound resonance and symbolic weight**.

### Examples
- **Tiala Calonwen** — “Heart-Light”
- **Amarant Calondorr** — “Undying Heartbreaker”
- **Gorllos Gwenisel** — “Ultimate Lotus of the Descending Path”

Names already fitting Cymora phonetics may remain unchanged.

---

## XI. Usage Guidelines

- Speak deliberately and with breath control
- Elongate vowels for sustained effects
- Emphasize **r** and **ll** for ritual force
- Rhythm and clarity matter more than grammatical purity

---

## XII. Canon Principle

> **Cymora does not describe magic.  
> Cymora performs it.**

Sound commands reality. Meaning guides intent.

---

## XIII. Expansion Notes

This codex is **intentionally open-ended**.  
New roots, spells, names, and ritual structures may be added so long as they preserve:
- Spoken-first design
- Phonetic harmony
- Resonant functionality

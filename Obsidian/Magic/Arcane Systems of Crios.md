*Supplemental Codex Entry*

This entry documents the **three distinct magic systems** operating within the Crios multirealm narrative.  
Each system obeys different metaphysical rules and cannot be freely substituted for another.

---

## I. BEESTON  
### [[Lúmenai]] - Harmonic Resonance Magic  
*(Primary System — Beeston and derivative realms)*

**Source:** Emotional truth and harmonic alignment  
**Fuel:** Resonance (not mana)  
**Access Method:** Singing / voicing / ensemble synchronization  

Lúmenai is detailed fully in the **Lúmenai Codex**.  
It is defined by Essentia tiers, harmonic strain, and ensemble amplification.

Key traits:
- Responds to emotional authenticity
- Power scales through resonance, not quantity
- Strongly influenced by relationships
- Catastrophic failure when harmony collapses

---

## II. ROYASTELLA  
### [[Elemental Core System]]  
*(Imperial / Structured Arc)*

**Source:** The System  
**Fuel:** Mana  
**Access Method:** Interface-authorized invocation  

Royastella magic is governed by an external metaphysical construct known as **the System**, which regulates access, power ceilings, and spell legality.

### Mana

Mana is a quantifiable, replenishable resource distributed and monitored by the System.

- Stored internally as a **Magic Core**
- Regenerates over time or via System-approved methods
- Depletes through spell execution

Mana does **not** require emotional alignment to function.

---

### Magic Core *(Royastella Only)*

Every Royastella caster possesses a **Magic Core**, a metaphysical organ that:

- Stores mana
- Determines maximum output
- Can fracture or overload

Core damage results in:
- Mana instability
- Identity desynchronization from the System

---

### System Constraints

Royastella magic prioritizes **control, scalability, and empire stability** over personal truth.

---

### Narrative Implications

- Royastella magic is reliable but rigid
- Emotional interference does not enhance spells
- System collapse creates magical vacuum events
- Lúmenai and Royastella magic interfere destructively when forced to interact

---

## III. NEXSICON  
### [[Cymora]] — Linguistic Magic  
*(Nexus / Interrealm Arc)*

**Source:** Meaning, symbol, and connection  
**Fuel:** Semantic coherence  
**Access Method:** Spoken Cymora  

Cymora is not powered by mana or resonance, but by **linguistic binding**.

Magic occurs when a concept is expressed with sufficient precision and contextual authority.

---

### Cymora Language

Cymora is an ancient, structured magical language.

Core properties:
- Every word encodes **function**, **intent**, and **scope**
- Grammar determines causality
- Syntax defines limitations
- Names carry binding weight

Errors do not cause spell failure — they cause **reinterpretation**.

---

### Cymora Casting

Power is constrained by:
- Speaker fluency
- Conceptual clarity
- Contextual truth
- Narrative relevance

---

### Risks

- Semantic drift
- Recursive clauses
- Self-binding names
- Unintended metaphors becoming literal

Cymora magic is the **most precise** system and the **least forgiving**.

---

## Cross-System Interactions

| Interaction | Result |
|---|---|
| Lúmenai × Royastella | Resonance destabilizes System permissions |
| Lúmenai × Cymora | Meaning amplifies or fractures harmony |
| Royastella × Cymora | Syntax overrides spell parameters |
| All Three | Reality shear events |

---

## Comparative Summary

| System | Fuel | Structure | Risk Profile |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lúmenai | Resonance | Harmonic | Emotional / Existential |
| Royastella | Mana | Systemic | Mechanical / Identity |
| Cymora | Meaning | Linguistic | Conceptual / Reality |

---

## Canon Notes

- No character can fully master more than **one** system without consequence.
- Hybrid use creates long-term narrative scars.
- Each system reflects the philosophy of its originating realm.

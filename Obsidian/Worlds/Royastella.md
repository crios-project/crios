## Overview

**Royastella** is a technologically structured martial realm within the Crios Multireality. Unlike resonance-based realities, Royastella operates through quantifiable magical engineering governed by a metaphysical construct known simply as **the System**.

Magic in Royastella is not expressive or emotional in nature. It is treated as a measurable internal resource called **Mana**, which can be trained, optimized, and exhausted. The realm is characterized by militarized nobility, structured societal hierarchies, and a defensive culture built around protecting the realm from interdimensional conquest.

---
## Cosmological Nature

Royastella is classified as a **System-Regulated Reality**, where metaphysical law is standardized through quantification and governed progression mechanics.
### Reality Structure

- **The System:** A universal construct that regulates magical capability, growth, and output.
- **Mana Capacity:** Determines spellcasting stamina and energy output.
- **Technique Architecture:** Magic manifests as structured techniques rather than emotional projection.
- **Combat Optimization:** Magical proficiency is enhanced through training metrics, efficiency protocols, and output refinement.

The System assigns measurable parameters to individuals, enabling controlled magical advancement similar to engineered progression.

## Magic System: System Mana

### Overview

System Mana is an internally generated, energy-based magical resource.
#### Core Principles

- Magic requires **no emotional synchronization**
- Mana is **stored, converted, and expended**
- Spells function as **technical techniques**
- Output is limited by endurance and training
- Overextension leads to exhaustion or System backlash

Royastella magic prioritizes discipline and execution precision over creative interpretation.

---
### Elemental Core Theory

Native Royastellans possess internalized metaphysical constructs known as **Elemental Cores**, which determine their natural affinity.
#### Core Elements

- Fire
- Water
- Wind
- Earth

Elemental Cores do not normally produce visible manifestations. Cores are thought to be immutable and unchanging.

---
### External Core Manifestation

The **Runic Knights of Starlite 7th** were trained by dissonant discord in advanced aura manifestation techniques allowing them to project their Elemental Cores externally.

Manifested Core Auras grant enhancements such as:

- Increased physical strength
- Enhanced defensive resilience
- Accelerated movement speed
- Improved cognitive processing
- Probability distortion and tactical foresight (rare cases)

---
### Core Variability 

The **Runic Knights of Starlite 7th** were also trained by dissonant discord in techniques allowing them to alter their Elemental Cores. By switching elemental cores, the Starlite 7th can change the enhancements they manifest.

---
### Conjoined Element Doctrine

Tier 2 or conjoined elemental manifestations do not within Royastella society. Such abilities have only ever manifested in external invaders seeking territorial conquest.

Royastella defense forces maintain strict vigilance against entities capable of conjoined elemental manipulation.

---
### Rare Core Phenomena

Certain Elemental Cores fall outside standard classification and are considered catastrophic or mythological anomalies.
#### Light Core
- Extremely rare
- Spell failure can induce unconsciousness
- Known User: [[Mahana Sahi]]
#### Dark Core
- Exceptionally dangerous
- Spell failure can permanently destroy magical capability or cause death
- Known Users:
  - [[BLADE GUILLOTINE]]
  - [[Starlit Alpha]]
#### Aether Core
- Does not exist
- Considered metaphysically impossible
- Due to the unstable manner of Aether, it's possible that any Aether Core formed would naturally unmake the person who manifested it.

## The Starlite 7th

The **Starlite 7th** is Royastella’s premier defensive Sentai-style task force tasked with protecting the realm from extraplanar invasion and internal catastrophic threats.

Each member is assigned both a royal title and combat specialization.
### Core Members

- [[Starlit Empress]] — Commander and tactical authority
- [[Starlit Sultana]] — Defensive operations specialist
- [[Starlit Rex]] — Heavy artillery and ranged assault specialist
- [[Starlit Pasha]] — High-speed precision striker
- [[Starlit Czar]] — Close-quarters combat enforcer
- [[Starlit Mikado]] — Dual-form adaptive weapon specialist

## Overview

**Cascade Resonance** is the largest recorded multiversal destabilization event in known cosmological history. It was triggered by [[Tiala Hartlight]] during an experimental Grand Magic designed to forcibly accelerate universal convergence and entropy collapse across multiple realities.

While the spell partially succeeded in weakening dimensional barriers and accelerated the merge, it resulted in catastrophic resonance feedback that fractured narrative causality, destabilized inter-realm continuity, and permanently altered the metaphysical structure of several worlds.

Cascade Resonance is widely regarded as the single most consequential magical disaster linked to modern convergence politics.

## The Grand Magic Catastrophe

Following the successful identification of **Lodesoul presence** across multiple realms, [[Tiala Hartlight]] attempted an unprecedented Grand Magic ritual.

### Intended Objective
The ritual aimed to:

- Force all known realities to merge into a singular dominant realm
- Anchor existence around the realm possessing the highest **Ontological Depth**
- Eliminate fragmented timeline divergence
- Stabilize destiny through forced narrative consolidation
- Accelerate the convergence timeline from approximately ten years to less than two.

Tiala theorized that unifying realities would prevent eventual multiversal entropy and collapse. She also sought to protect all the realms by merging said realms into one singular realm.

---
### Outcome

The ritual succeeded only partially.

Instead of controlled convergence, it triggered an uncontrolled resonance chain reaction across dimensional boundaries.

The resulting phenomenon became known as **Cascade Resonance**. While the timeline of the merge was shortened significantly, there were numerous detrimental results.

---
## Primary Effects

### Narrative Probability Failure

Reality began rejecting established causality rules. Events that were statistically or logically impossible began manifesting across multiple realms.

Examples include:

- Temporal inconsistencies
- Retroactive historical contradictions
- Individuals experiencing overlapping life memories from alternate timelines

---
### Cross-Realm Entity Displacement

Individuals and entities were forcibly relocated across realms without transitional stabilization.

Displacement side effects included:

- Identity desynchronization
- Magic incompatibility stress
- Partial existence fragmentation
- Cultural and historical dislocation

---
### Emergence of Impossible Phenomena

Lost civilizations, extinct magical disciplines, and suppressed mythic entities began manifesting spontaneously.

These included:

- Realm overlays resembling lost mythic domains
- Sudden reactivation of ancient artifacts
- Awakening of dormant cosmological constructs

---

### Accelerated Metaphysical Entropy

The boundary between existence and nonexistence weakened in several convergence zones, increasing the rate of reality decay.

Observable symptoms included:

- Mana field collapse
- Dimensional erosion
- Temporal looping fractures
- Increased Void incursion probability

---

### Breakdown of Causal Continuity

Certain events lost linear cause-and-effect relationships. This resulted in paradox instability, including:

- Events occurring before their causes
- Individuals retaining memory of futures that never occur
- Narrative recursion loops

---

## Organizational Collapse

Cascade Resonance directly triggered the downfall of [[Praxis Verax Affinas]].

The crisis generated internal ideological fractures, operational instability, and emotional trauma among its members.

---
### Disappearance of [[Xīwàng Tiānshàng]]

One of the most devastating consequences was the unexplained disappearance of Xīwàng during peak resonance instability. Her disappearance remains unresolved and is considered a primary emotional catalyst for subsequent faction fragmentation.

---

### Emergence of New Factions

#### [[Destiny's Penance]]

Formed by Tiala as both continuation and atonement for the damage caused by Cascade Resonance. The organization seeks to complete convergence under controlled conditions while accepting moral burden for past actions.
#### [[Reason Theory]]

Established by [[Ami Hartbreak]] and [[Windi Lightfall]] as an ideological counterforce opposing deterministic convergence and prophecy-based governance structures.

---

## Cosmological Consequences

Cascade Resonance permanently altered multiversal mechanics:

- Increased permeability between Royastella and Beeston
- Heightened Lodesoul sensitivity across realms
- Instability in large-scale synchronization magic systems

Several realms remain in partial convergence limbo, awaiting full integration or total collapse.

---

## Theoretical Interpretations

Scholars and convergence theorists disagree on the true nature of Cascade Resonance.

### Deterministic Failure Theory
Cascade Resonance represents the inevitable result of artificially forcing narrative consolidation.

### Partial Success Theory
Some believe the ritual did succeed, but in a distributed rather than centralized convergence model.

### Lodesoul Interference Theory
Suggests that the presence or movement of Lodesouls altered the intended spell trajectory.

---

## Psychological and Cultural Impact

Cascade Resonance shifted multiversal attitudes toward Grand Magic experimentation. Many societies now treat large-scale convergence rituals as existential threats rather than heroic endeavors.

The event also created enduring trauma among surviving participants and contributed heavily to the moral complexity surrounding Tiala’s legacy.

## Known Survivors Directly Affected

- [[Tiala Hartlight]]
- [[Ami Hartbreak]]
- [[Windi Lightfall]]
- [[Claris Quies]]
- [[Jí Lián Xía]]
- [[Fú cì]]

---

## Current Status

Cascade Resonance remains active at low-level fluctuations across several realms. Periodic resonance surges continue to produce minor displacement anomalies and narrative distortions.

Complete stabilization has never been achieved.

---

## Trivia (Out-of-Universe)

- Cascade Resonance serves as the central inciting disaster event connecting multiple narrative arcs.
- The event represents themes of ambition exceeding moral foresight.
- Ontological Depth functions as a metaphysical measurement of a realm’s narrative density and stability.
- The phenomenon acts as the narrative justification for cross-realm character interactions and timeline variance.

## Overview

The **Lodesoul Theorem** is a controversial multiversal cosmological theory proposing the existence of singular individuals whose existence serves as a structural constant within reality itself. These individuals are designated **Lodesouls** — entities whose presence stabilizes, defines, or influences the trajectory of their native universe.

The theorem challenges the long-held metaphysical assumption that all sentient beings possess equivalent existential weight. Instead, it suggests that certain individuals function as narrative and structural keystones whose continuity directly affects universal cohesion.

## Primary Definition

A **Lodesoul** is defined as:

> A being whose existence is so singularly influential that their removal destabilizes the meaning, progression, or survivability of their originating reality.

The concept is often illustrated through literary analogies:

- Sherlock Holmes without Sherlock Holmes ceases to be Sherlock Holmes.
- The Great Gatsby without Jay Gatsby loses its central narrative gravity.

The theorem extrapolates this narrative concept into cosmological function, proposing that certain individuals serve as existential anchors around which reality organizes itself.

## Classical Lodesoul Model

Early interpretations describe Lodesouls as **metaphysical anchors**, suggesting:

- Their existence maintains universal narrative coherence.
- Their disappearance accelerates existential entropy.
- Their survival ensures reality retains definitional structure.

Under this model, a universe deprived of its Lodesoul does not immediately collapse, but gradually deteriorates into purposeless instability, ultimately progressing toward oblivion.

## Nexsican Conduit Theory

A rival interpretation emerging from Nexsicon reframes Lodesouls as **interdimensional conduits** rather than anchors. This scientific hypothesis proposes that Lodesouls act as resonance bridges between realities.

### Core Conduit Postulates

1. **Realm Removal Stability**

   Removing a Lodesoul from their native realm does **not** cause immediate destruction or collapse of that realm.

2. **Inter-Realm Attraction**

   Transferring a Lodesoul into a foreign realm causes the originating and destination realities to gravitationally converge, eventually merging.

3. **Continuity Preservation**

   The destruction of a Lodesoul does not result in permanent eradication. Instead, the Lodesoul essence:
   - Regenerates within the same realm, or
   - Transfers into a new host entity

## The Nexsicon Incident

The Conduit Theory gained credibility following an unsanctioned experimental event within Nexsicon.

A Nexsican researcher investigating interrealm resonance documented a case in which his daughter inadvertently summoned a Lodesoul from an unnamed, non-magical realm. The resulting phenomenon triggered the gradual convergence and fusion of both realms.

The merging event produced several unprecedented effects:

- Manifestation of mythological lost civilizations previously believed to exist only in cultural memory
- Appearance of legendary realms including:
  - Atlantis  
  - Lemuria  
  - Mu  
  - Agartha  
  - El Dorado  
  - Shangri-La  
  - Shambhala  
  - Avalon  

These emergent realms appeared to exist as dormant or displaced realities stabilized through Lodesoul convergence.

## Suppression of Research

Despite empirical evidence supporting Conduit Theory, the discovery generated significant political and existential concern. Global Nexsican authorities and scientific institutions declared further Lodesoul experimentation **verboten**, citing unacceptable risks including:

- Uncontrolled realm fusion
- Irreversible dimensional instability
- Potential erasure of existing realities
- Emergence of unknown mytho-historical entities

The originating researcher was prohibited from publishing or presenting his findings. Unable to reveal evidence without severe legal repercussions, he surrendered all recorded data and research materials to regulatory authorities.

## Disappearance of the Researcher

Shortly after relinquishing his work, the researcher vanished under unexplained circumstances. No confirmed record of his location, status, or fate has been verified. Speculation ranges from voluntary exile to containment by undisclosed Nexsican oversight bodies.

---

## Philosophical Implications

The Lodesoul Theorem introduces several unresolved existential questions:

- Is reality structured around individuals or events?
- Are Lodesouls predestined or emergent phenomena?
- Can Lodesoul convergence be intentionally weaponized?
- Do merged realms retain independent ontological identity?
- Is destruction of a Lodesoul truly impossible, or merely cyclical?

---

## Known Risks

Scholars classify Lodesoul manipulation as **Cosmic Tier Hazard** due to the potential for:

- Multiversal chain-reaction mergers
- Temporal paradox amplification
- Mythic realm re-manifestation
- Narrative collapse across connected realities

---

## Current Scientific Status

The Lodesoul Theorem remains:

- Empirically supported but politically suppressed  
- Heavily restricted in Nexsican academic circles  
- Studied primarily through clandestine or theoretical cosmological research  

---

## Terminology

**Lodesoul**  
An existential singularity entity whose continuity influences universal stability or interrealm resonance.

**Conduit Event**  
The merging of realities triggered by Lodesoul transference.

**Anchor Model**  
The theory that Lodesouls stabilize reality internally.

**Conduit Model**  
The theory that Lodesouls connect realities externally.

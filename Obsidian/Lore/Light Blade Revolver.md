### Weapon Classification

**Hybrid Transforming Arcane Firearm / Energy Melee System**
### Overview

The **Light Blade Revolver** is a multi-configuration combat weapon engineered to complement [[Alulu Dayk]]’s precision-based fighting doctrine. The weapon dynamically shifts between ranged suppression, surgical melee strikes, and high-output execution modes. Each transformation emphasizes efficiency, adaptability, and finishing power, mirroring Alulu’s philosophy of ending battles through decisive, critical damage rather than prolonged engagement.

The weapon channels condensed stellar mana into solidified photonic blades and projectile constructs. Its EX configurations overclock the internal mana lattice, dramatically increasing destructive output at the cost of high magical expenditure.

### Tactical Integration with Alulu’s Fighting Style

The Light Blade Revolver enables Alulu to:

- Transition fluidly between ranged and melee dominance
- Exploit weak points through precision and adaptability
- Maintain combat tempo while conserving magical resources
- Escalate force proportionally until decisive victory is assured

Her combat pattern commonly progresses:

1. Observation and suppression (Standard / Sniper)
2. Pressure and destabilization (Knife Gun / Whip Blade)
3. Precision execution (Light Blade / Scythe Forms)
4. Final annihilation if necessary (EX Modes)

---
### Limitations

- EX forms significantly drain magical stamina
- Overuse risks temporary weapon destabilization or mana feedback
- Requires high concentration and control to safely transition between configurations

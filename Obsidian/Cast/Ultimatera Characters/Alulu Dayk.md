After claiming the [[Light Blade Revolver]] and gaining the title of Dayk (a name for honored warriors), Alulu spent the next two years training with it to form a new fighting style. 

Alulu Dayk employs a relentless, tempo-driven combat style centered around continuous weapon manifestation and kinetic strike chaining. Her methodology blends refined martial arts fundamentals with instantaneous summoning of the Light Blade Revolver's multiple configurations, allowing her to shift between ranged, mid-range, and close-quarters combat without disrupting her offensive rhythm.

Unlike traditional weapon specialists who commit to a single armament or stance, Alulu treats her arsenal as a fluid extension of motion itself. The Light Blade Revolver is not simply wielded—it is invoked at the exact moment her physical momentum demands it, appearing only long enough to deliver maximum impact before dissolving back into dormant form. This creates an unpredictable combat cadence where each strike carries the potential to manifest an entirely different threat profile.

Alulu’s fighting rhythm is built on continuous forward pressure. She favors initiating engagements with rapid movement and layered attacks designed to overwhelm an opponent’s ability to track her weapon transitions. A single combination may begin with rapid suppressive fire from the revolver’s standard configuration, seamlessly transition into a close-range burst from the knife gun form to destabilize defenses, and conclude with precision piercing attacks using the light blade configuration. These transitions occur without visible delay, giving her combat style an almost musical flow of escalating intensity.

Her use of the revolver’s long-range sniper configuration reflects her strategic patience and battlefield awareness. Alulu frequently integrates sudden disengagements, acrobatic repositioning, or aerial redirection into her offense, materializing the sniper form mid-motion to punish exposed vulnerabilities. These moments serve not as retreats, but as tactical reframing that forces opponents to constantly readjust their defensive priorities.

When engagements escalate, Alulu demonstrates her most aggressive tendencies through the EX weapon manifestations. The enhanced light blade form amplifies both cutting power and strike coverage, allowing her to deliver sweeping offensive arcs while maintaining thrusting precision. Similarly, the scythe gun configurations transform her fighting style into one focused on rapid dismemberment and mobility denial. These forms are devastating but taxing, consuming significant magical reserves, and are therefore deployed only during decisive combat phases or finishing sequences.

The whip blade manifestation introduces a dramatic expansion of her threat radius. Alulu utilizes it to manipulate battlefield spacing, entangle opponents, or execute wide-area slashing trajectories that disrupt formations. The flexibility of this configuration allows her to maintain pressure even against opponents attempting to disengage or maintain distance.

Despite the apparent complexity of her arsenal, Alulu’s movements remain tightly coordinated and purposeful. Her martial arts foundation emphasizes rotational force, controlled footwork, and precise strike alignment, ensuring that each summoned weapon emerges at the optimal vector of attack. This synthesis of physical discipline and instantaneous armament creates a combat presence that feels both calculated and overwhelming.

Psychologically, Alulu exerts pressure through unpredictability and sustained aggression. Opponents often find themselves unable to anticipate whether the next strike will deliver a ballistic discharge, a piercing blade thrust, or a sweeping disabling cut. Her refusal to allow defensive stabilization forces adversaries into reactive combat patterns, gradually eroding their composure and strategic cohesion.

Alulu’s fighting philosophy centers on adaptability through abundance—the belief that mastery lies not in perfecting a single weapon, but in wielding an entire arsenal as a seamless expression of movement and intent. Her combat style embodies momentum, precision, and escalating lethality, making her most dangerous when she is allowed to dictate the tempo of battle.

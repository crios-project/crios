## Overview
Tiala Hartlight is a driven and enigmatic figure whose ambitions stretch far beyond conventional limits. Her presence is marked by an unwavering focus and emotional intensity that often unsettles even her closest companions.

## Personality
Tiala is fiercely determined and emotionally guarded. Her internal motivations are rarely expressed openly, creating an aura of mystery around her actions. She demonstrates exceptional resolve and a willingness to endure significant personal and moral cost in pursuit of her objectives. While she maintains connections with her friends, she keeps them at a deliberate emotional distance.

## Motivations
Tiala is singularly focused on accessing the Akashic Record. In pursuit of this goal, she has undertaken monumental feats, including merging the mythic domains of Atlantis, Mu, and Lemuria into a single convergent realm. Her intent is to defeat their ancient guardians and claim legendary artifacts such as:
- Ars Goetia
- Tablet of Destinies
- Book of Raziel
- Additional unknown arcane relics

Her motivations remain heavily debated among those close to her. Interpretations include:
- Attempting to prevent a catastrophic future event
- Being the catalyst for that very catastrophe
- Acting under the emotional trauma of losing her best friend, Xīwàng

## Moral Trajectory
Tiala acknowledges that her path requires sacrifices and increasingly destructive actions. She continues forward despite recognizing the potential consequences, hoping that the cost of her ambition will not ultimately consume what remains of her humanity.

## Notable Relationships

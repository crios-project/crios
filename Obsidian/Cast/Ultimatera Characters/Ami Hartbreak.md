## Overview
Ami Hartbreak carries herself with effortless elegance paired with a mischievous, playful disposition. Once closely tied to [[Praxis Verax Affinas]], Ami distanced herself following personal conflict and has since redefined herself through independence, style, and calculated irreverence. While she projects poise and approachability, her playful subversion often reveals itself through elaborate but harmless pranks.

## Personality
Ami blends charm, composure, and humor into a carefully balanced social presence. She rarely appears flustered or hurried, maintaining a naturally refined aura that draws others toward her. Her easygoing demeanor makes her highly approachable, though she uses this trust as the perfect setup for her mischievous tendencies.

Her sense of humor leans toward theatrical irony and lighthearted manipulation. While she enjoys creating chaos for entertainment, she draws a firm personal boundary against causing genuine harm. Her pranks are designed to surprise, embarrass, or inconvenience — never to damage or destroy.

## Behavioral Traits
- Maintains impeccable fashion and visual presentation with little visible effort
- Uses social charisma as both genuine expression and tactical misdirection
- Demonstrates refined composure even while orchestrating elaborate pranks
- Exhibits playful defiance toward authority and expectations
- Maintains strong emotional independence, often masking deeper feelings behind humor

## Identity and Name Change
Ami’s adoption of the surname **Hartbreak** was a deliberate act of provocation directed toward Tiala following their falling out. The change reflects both her willingness to weaponize symbolism and her inclination toward theatrical personal expression. Despite its outwardly comedic nature, the name represents unresolved emotional complexity beneath her carefree exterior.

## Alliances
### Windi
After leaving [[Praxis Verax Affinas]], Ami formed an alliance with Windi. Their partnership centers on disrupting the ambitions of their respective siblings. Ami’s motivations are rooted in amusement and rebellion, whereas Windi’s reasons remain largely undisclosed, creating a partnership built on asymmetrical intent.

## Social Dynamics
Ami is widely admired and socially magnetic. Her natural elegance and relaxed confidence cause others to gravitate toward her easily. However, acquaintances often find themselves unexpectedly targeted by her pranks, resulting in a reputation that balances admiration with cautious wariness.

## Relationship with Tiala
Ami and Tiala’s relationship deteriorated following Xīwàng’s disappearance, culminating in a significant emotional rupture. While Ami outwardly treats the conflict with humor and irreverence, her continued symbolic provocations suggest lingering emotional investment beneath her composed exterior.

## Personal Philosophy
Ami believes life should be enjoyed with style, wit, and controlled unpredictability. She values freedom of expression and views rigid seriousness as something to be gently mocked rather than confronted directly.

Kesshō Tǐ mirrors the refined, flowing lethality displayed by [[Kesshō Yīng]], maintaining the same foundation of elegant, high-speed bladework and aerial maneuverability. However, where Yīng embodies grace and precision as an art, Tǐ expresses combat as an unrelenting campaign of calculated domination.

Her movements retain their dancer-like fluidity, but each step advances territory, each strike establishes control, and every motion pressures opponents into defensive collapse. She fights with the mentality of overwhelming inevitability—never rushing blindly, yet never allowing adversaries the stability needed to recover or regroup.

Tǐ favors aggressive forward momentum. She chains attacks into prolonged offensive sequences designed to exhaust resistance through layered strike patterns. Rather than relying solely on surgical eliminations, she destabilizes opponents through sustained pressure, forcing errors that she exploits with devastating finishing blows.

Her aerial combat is particularly oppressive. She uses altitude and velocity not just for mobility, but for tactical positioning, striking from angles that divide enemy focus and disrupt formations. She frequently alternates between rapid flurries and heavy, decisive cleaves, creating unpredictable tempo shifts that fracture defensive timing.

Unlike Yīng’s emphasis on beauty and technical mastery, Tǐ demonstrates tactical severity. She anticipates counterattacks several exchanges ahead and adapts instantly, turning enemy momentum into opportunities for escalation. When facing multiple opponents, she instinctively prioritizes targets whose defeat will cause the greatest strategic collapse among their allies.

Her presence on the battlefield often alters the rhythm of combat entirely. Opponents are forced into reactionary fighting, struggling to reclaim initiative as she dictates pacing, spacing, and engagement flow with commanding authority.

At her peak, Tǐ’s combat becomes less a duel and more a systematic conquest of the battlefield itself, where victory is achieved through relentless advancement and absolute control.

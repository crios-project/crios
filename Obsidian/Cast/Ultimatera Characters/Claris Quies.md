## Overview
Claris Quies is a chaotic burst of energy whose personality radiates spontaneity and emotional intensity. Equal parts gothic aesthetic and punk irreverence, she thrives in situations where unpredictability reigns. Her presence often disrupts careful planning, but her loyalty to her friends is absolute and unquestionable.

## Personality
Claris is exuberant, impulsive, and gleefully unpredictable. Rather than maturing into restraint, she has grown increasingly energetic and uninhibited over time. She tends to follow whatever option seems the most entertaining or emotionally satisfying in the moment, regardless of consequences. Her shamelessness is worn openly and unapologetically, contributing to both her charm and her volatility.

Despite her chaotic tendencies, Claris possesses a deeply rooted protective instinct toward those she considers friends. Beneath her erratic surface lies a steadfast emotional loyalty that manifests fiercely when those she cares about are threatened.

## Behavioral Traits
- Frequently acts without hesitation or long-term planning
- Gravitate toward excitement, spectacle, and emotional authenticity
- Displays dramatic mood shifts that can either uplift or destabilize group dynamics
- Shows little concern for embarrassment or social restraint
- Maintains strong protective loyalty toward companions

## Identity Evolution
Claris represents a stark divergence from her past self as Zafara. Where Zafara embodied greater control and composure, Claris operates with far less restraint, embracing instinct, chaos, and emotional expression. The degree to which Claris is a transformation, liberation, or fragmentation of Zafara remains a subject of interpretation among those who knew her before.

## Social Dynamics
Claris’ relentless energy can mildly exhaust her friends, yet her sincerity and devotion make her an irreplaceable ally. She frequently destabilizes otherwise structured environments but often provides unexpected solutions precisely because of her unconventional thinking.

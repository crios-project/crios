Tessera Iustum is the magical girl form of [[Claris Quies]] though Tessera Iustum is actually a second magical girl form of [[Zafara Quedar]] at that point in the timeline.

Tessera practices a highly adaptive, improvisational combat style built around environmental manipulation, misdirection, and fluid transitions between offense and defense. Her approach mirrors the unpredictability and kinetic creativity of an expert trickster-combatant, blending acrobatics, object interaction, and precise blade work into a seamless and often overwhelming fighting rhythm.

Unlike conventional swordsmen who maintain strict stances or formalized technique chains, Tessera treats the battlefield itself as an extension of her arsenal. She instinctively incorporates surrounding terrain, loose objects, and structural features into her attacks and evasions. Furniture, debris, railings, or even an opponent’s weapon can become tools for deflection, redirection, or sudden counterstrikes. This constant adaptation makes her movements difficult to anticipate or strategically counter.

Her katana, Fallire Fanale, is central to her fighting methodology. The weapon’s ability to manifest and dematerialize at will allows Tessera to weaponize timing and deception. She frequently dismisses the blade mid-motion to evade grapples, slip through narrow defensive openings, or bait opponents into misjudging her reach. The blade can then be instantly reformed to deliver rapid follow-up strikes, often from unexpected angles or positions. This ability allows her to transition between unarmed martial techniques and armed swordplay without interrupting her combat flow.

Tessera favors mobility and momentum over direct confrontation. She employs rapid directional shifts, rolling recoveries, vaulting maneuvers, and exaggerated but controlled falls that double as defensive evasions or setup opportunities. Many of her attacks appear spontaneous, yet they are guided by sharp situational awareness and tactical intuition. She excels at turning disadvantageous positions into sudden counteroffensive openings.

Her combat presence often appears chaotic or playful, masking a lethally efficient precision. Tessera deliberately creates confusion through erratic rhythm changes, feigned clumsiness, and unconventional attack patterns. Opponents frequently underestimate her during these moments, only to find themselves caught in precisely timed and highly targeted finishing strikes.

While she rarely relies on overwhelming force, Tessera demonstrates exceptional control, accuracy, and reaction speed. Her fighting philosophy centers on adaptability, opportunism, and the belief that victory belongs to the combatant who best understands and exploits the shifting conditions of battle.

Tessera generally carries the bladeless hilt of Fallire Fanale when not in combat, but she can summon the weapon to the ready in a microsecond. It hasn't fully accepted Tessera as its wielder yet.

Zhòu-chún Shìfàng represents the earliest manifested combat state of the individual who would later evolve into [[Zhòu-chún Tǎoyàn]], emerging during her tenure as [[Fú cì Ánguāng.]] At this stage, her fighting style retains emotional openness and kinetic exuberance, lacking the austere lethality and quiet restraint that later define her matured forms. Her combat expression is energetic, expressive, and heavily momentum-driven, reflecting both youthful confidence and an instinctive desire to protect rather than dismantle.

Her core fighting methodology centers on high-impact barehanded combat strongly aligned with modernized martial striking disciplines. She favors rapid combination attacks built around fluid punch-kick transitions, aerial repositioning, and explosive closing bursts that overwhelm opponents through sustained offensive pressure. Her engagement pattern emphasizes maintaining proximity, forcing adversaries into reactive defense while continuously shifting striking angles. She frequently integrates acrobatic maneuvering into her offensive chains, allowing her to redirect momentum into spinning strikes, rising launchers, and rapid directional feints that destabilize enemy counterattacks.

Shìfàng’s defensive structure relies heavily on kinetic redirection rather than static guarding. She prefers slipping, weaving, and rolling evasions that naturally convert into counteroffensive openings. Her movement demonstrates strong center-of-gravity control, allowing her to recover balance instantly after aerial or rotational attacks. While not as technically refined as her later forms, her unpredictability and relentless tempo make her extremely difficult to suppress in sustained engagements.

Unlike her elder sister [[Xīwàng Tiānshàng]], Shìfàng retains limited magical compatibility, which she employs as tactical augmentation rather than primary offense. Her spell usage manifests as short-duration enhancements that reinforce striking power, accelerate movement bursts, or provide momentary defensive buffering. These augmentations are modest in output and require deliberate concentration, preventing simultaneous high-level martial execution and magical channeling. As a result, she typically deploys these abilities in transitional windows between attack sequences or during brief disengagements.

Her emotional state significantly influences her combat rhythm. Shìfàng fights with visible warmth and expressive determination, often telegraphing her protective motivations through aggressive interception tactics and body positioning that prioritizes shielding allies. This emotional transparency fuels her stamina and offensive persistence but can also create exploitable moments when she overextends in response to perceived threats against those she cares about.

Zhòu-chún Shìfàng’s fighting style embodies unrestrained momentum and hopeful ferocity. While lacking the surgical precision and controlled devastation associated with her later evolution, her blend of acrobatic striking, improvisational flow, and supplementary spell reinforcement creates a combatant defined by overwhelming drive and emotionally charged resilience.

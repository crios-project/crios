### Overview

Tiala Corsolis exists less as a conventional individual and more as a transitional constant moving between realms. She rarely manifests directly within a single plane of existence, instead expressing herself through alternate presences that emerge across different worlds. These manifestations operate as localized avatars through which her influence is exerted, often without the surrounding populations recognizing their shared origin.

Across known realms, her appearances include:

- manifesting as [[dissonant discord]] within **[[Beeston]]**
- appearing as the catastrophic Dark-aligned force [[BLADE GUILLOTINE]] within **[[Royastella]]**
- expressing calculated execution and radiant lethality as [[Alulu Caelum]] within **[[Nexsicon]]**

While these incarnations possess independent personalities, memories, and motivations, they remain intrinsically linked through an underlying metaphysical continuity anchored in Tiala’s existence.

### Appearance

Tiala presents as a teenage girl of slender but balanced build. Her physical presence carries an understated intensity, often described as quietly radiant. Her purple eyes are particularly striking, frequently perceived as holding layered emotional and perceptual depth that can make sustained eye contact unsettling or mesmerizing.

Her demeanor tends toward calm observation rather than overt emotional expression, contributing to the sense that she is perpetually slightly out of sync with her immediate surroundings.

### Nature and Existence

Tiala functions as a liminal entity, naturally positioned between states, identities, and dimensional boundaries. Rather than remaining fixed within a single reality, she traverses existential thresholds through a phenomenon often described as **phasewalking**. These transitions are rarely witnessed directly and frequently leave behind residual distortions in magical, emotional, or conceptual space.

Her alternate manifestations do not simply represent disguises or transformations. Each operates as a fully realized iteration shaped by the laws, magic systems, and narrative pressures of its host realm. Despite this fragmentation, certain thematic consistencies persist across all forms, including:

- Strong associations with culmination or finality  
- Exceptional combat lethality  
- Emotional intensity masked beneath controlled composure  
- A recurring role in events involving systemic upheaval or paradigm shifts

### Magical and Metaphysical Alignment

Tiala’s true elemental or metaphysical alignment remains unclassified. Each known manifestation interacts with its respective world’s magical structure differently:

- In **Beeston**, her presence emerges through discordant harmonic anomalies tied to Lúmenai resonance disruption.
- In **Royastella**, her manifestation demonstrates compatibility with extreme Dark-aligned phenomena and catastrophic combat expression.
- In **Nexsicon**, her incarnation channels highly precise and destructive applications of Cymoran combat methodology.

No singular system fully explains or contains her existence, suggesting her origin lies beyond standard elemental or systemic categorization.

### Personality

Direct observations of Tiala herself are exceedingly rare, making definitive personality profiling difficult. However, consistent behavioral threads across her manifestations suggest she possesses:

- Deep introspection  
- Strong internal emotional currents held beneath restrained outward composure  
- A persistent gravitational pull toward pivotal or climactic events  
- A complex relationship with identity, continuity, and self-fragmentation

### Etymology

- **Tiala** derives from the teal color (#008080), symbolically representing balance between emotional depth and clarity.
- **Corsolis** combines *Cor* and *Solis*, Latin for **Heart** and **Sun**, reflecting themes of internal intensity and radiant culmination.

### Notes

Tiala’s existence suggests the possibility of entities that function as cross-realm constants, capable of expressing multiple fully autonomous iterations while maintaining a unified existential core. The full scope of her origin, purpose, and ultimate trajectory remains unknown.

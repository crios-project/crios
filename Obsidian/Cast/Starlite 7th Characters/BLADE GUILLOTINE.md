### Overview

BLADE GUILLOTINE is an anomaly among the Runic Knights — a living executioner archetype whose existence is defined by the dismantling of authority, power structures, and battlefield momentum. While the Runic Knights traditionally embody ruling archetypes, BLADE GUILLOTINE represents the instrument designed to end them.

Her battlefield presence is synonymous with abrupt reversals of fortune. Engagements that appear stable or victorious frequently collapse upon her arrival, as she specializes in isolating and dismantling pivotal combatants with surgical inevitability.

Despite being aligned with the Runic Knights in operational contexts, BLADE GUILLOTINE maintains a fully independent ideology and has never demonstrated true allegiance to their hierarchy or objectives. Thus is why they never antipathetic her betrayal. 

---

### Appearance

BLADE GUILLOTINE presents as an austere and imposing figure whose aesthetic blends ceremonial executioner symbolism with aristocratic dueling tradition.

Her visual motifs frequently incorporate:
- Stark monochromatic or muted color palettes
- Sharp, elongated silhouette elements that mirror her epee's design language
- Accents reminiscent of judicial or ceremonial attire
- Void-aligned energy distortions that subtly disrupt surrounding light

Her presence alone often produces psychological destabilization among both allies and enemies.

---

### Personality

BLADE GUILLOTINE operates according to a predator’s code rather than a knight’s oath.

#### Core Traits:
- Ruthlessly pragmatic
- Combat-obsessed, though selectively so
- Utterly indifferent to collateral consequence when deprived of worthy opposition
- Displays a strict, personal definition of honor centered on combat excellence

She values challenge above ideology and respects only those capable of meeting her standards in battle. Weakness, political maneuvering, or ceremonial authority structures hold no significance to her worldview.

Her relationship with violence is neither emotional nor malicious. It is recreational, ritualistic, and existentially validating.

---

### Combat Philosophy

BLADE GUILLOTINE specializes in targeted elimination and momentum collapse. Rather than engaging entire forces directly, she dismantles leadership structures, support linchpins, and power amplifiers, causing enemy formations to fracture internally.

Her fighting style emphasizes:
- Precision over spectacle
- Minimal movement with maximum lethality
- Opportunistic counters
- Psychological warfare through inevitability rather than intimidation

She often deliberately prolongs combat against powerful adversaries to extract maximum engagement value.

---

### Weapon: Le Couteau (Piercing focused Epee) 

Her epee is optimized for surgical lethality and instantaneous execution strikes.

**Combat Characteristics:**
- Exceptional thrusting velocity
- Hyper-precise targeting of mana conduits and structural weak points
- Void resonance that disrupts defensive enchantments
- Near-perfect synergy with her suppression abilities

The weapon functions less as a tool and more as an extension of her perceptual combat instincts.

---

### Moonlight Curse — Suppression

Unlike most elite combatants who wield Starlight Blessings, BLADE GUILLOTINE is bound to a Moonlight Curse.

#### Passive Effect:
- Constantly weakens active Starlight Blessings within her engagement radius
- Reduces enhancement amplification, defensive miracles, and coordinated resonance effects

#### Surge State:
- Completely disables Starlight Blessings within range
- Temporarily severs celestial empowerment channels
- Forces opponents to rely solely on inherent skill, physical conditioning, or external systems

This ability makes her one of the most dangerous anti-elite combatants in recorded history.

---

### Mana State

BLADE GUILLOTINE’s Mana Activation remains perpetually online, granting her constant Void-channel reinforcement.

Her Surge functions as a manually triggered escalation state, dramatically increasing:
- Suppression potency
- Physical acceleration
- Perception speed
- Strike lethality

Surge cannot be maintained indefinitely but is capable of determining the outcome of entire battles when deployed strategically.

---

### Relationship with the Starlite 7th

BLADE GUILLOTINE occupies a paradoxical position relative to the [[Starlite 7th]].

She has:
- Intervened repeatedly to prevent their defeat
- Never accepted formal membership
- Demonstrated no loyalty to their mission, only to the existence of compelling adversaries

The Starlite 7th regard her as a catastrophic but occasionally indispensable ally. This perception lasts until she betrays them before [[Symphonic Overture]], at which time they see her fully as an antagonist. 

---

### Behavioral Patterns

BLADE GUILLOTINE is known to:
- Appear without warning during pivotal combat turning points
- Ignore lesser opponents entirely
- Withdraw instantly if no opponent meets her criteria
- Demonstrate complete disinterest in post-conflict consequences

Her presence is often interpreted as a harbinger of decisive and irreversible outcomes.

---

### Symbolism and Themes

BLADE GUILLOTINE represents:

- The collapse of inherited authority
- Skill as the only legitimate form of sovereignty
- Combat as existential validation
- The inevitability of equalization through destruction
- The danger of power structures built without merit

---

### Miscellaneous Notes

- BLADE GUILLOTINE does not consider herself a thorn to the Runic Knights. Their discomfort with her presence is not reciprocated.
- She has never displayed interest in governance, conquest, or ideological victory.
- Historical records suggest she actively cultivates the existence of powerful opponents rather than eliminating them prematurely.

### Combat Profile

BLADE GUILLOTINE utilizes a tempo-driven dueling style centered around elegant thrusting épée technique augmented by high-tier dark magic integration. Her combat presence emphasizes fluid motion, surgical precision, and an almost celebratory appreciation for high-level combat exchanges. While her methodology shares structural similarities with [[dissonant discord]]—notably rhythmic movement and seamless magical integration—BLADE GUILLOTINE’s execution is more focused on testing strength and skill rather than asserting dominance through overwhelming suppression.

Her primary weapon, **Le Couteau**, is a thrust-optimized épée designed for extreme penetration efficiency and precision targeting. Unlike slash-oriented fencing systems, BLADE GUILLOTINE’s technique revolves around direct linear engagement, exploiting minimal openings to deliver decisive, armor-piercing strikes. Each thrust is delivered with exceptional alignment control, allowing her to target structural weak points, magical focal nodes, or vital anatomical vectors with remarkable consistency.

Her movement style resembles choreographed dance, characterized by graceful pivots, sweeping directional transitions, and continuous momentum preservation. She rarely plants her stance for extended durations, instead maintaining constant motion that disguises attack initiation and resets her engagement angle after each exchange. This flowing locomotion allows her to maintain offensive pressure while simultaneously positioning for evasive repositioning or counterthrust opportunities.

Like dissonant discord, BLADE GUILLOTINE integrates Tier 4 dark magic directly into her blade techniques. However, where discord often deploys layered battlefield manipulation and suppression effects, BLADE GUILLOTINE favors enhancement-based dark magic applications. Her spellcasting commonly reinforces thrust velocity, extends penetration reach through spatial distortion, or amplifies kinetic impact at the moment of contact. These enhancements often remain subtle, prioritizing dueling purity rather than large-scale environmental domination.

BLADE GUILLOTINE displays a pronounced theatrical flair during combat, frequently maintaining confident composure and expressive body language throughout engagements. Unlike discord’s predatory amusement, however, BLADE GUILLOTINE’s theatricality reflects competitive enthusiasm. She actively seeks formidable opponents and often escalates her output deliberately to match or slightly exceed her adversary’s demonstrated capability. Her approach is driven by a genuine fascination with measuring strength through combat, treating battles as mutual tests rather than unilateral executions.

This mindset results in a controlled but deliberate escalation pattern. BLADE GUILLOTINE often begins engagements with refined technical exchanges, observing opponent skill and adaptability before gradually introducing enhanced magical reinforcement. When confronted with exceptional resistance, she demonstrates willingness to push her own limits, occasionally prioritizing combat satisfaction over tactical efficiency.

In multi-opponent scenarios, BLADE GUILLOTINE relies heavily on mobility and line-of-engagement management. Rather than isolating targets through suppression fields, she manipulates spacing through rapid directional shifts and rotational footwork, forcing adversaries into sequential engagement patterns. This allows her to maintain dueling flow even while facing multiple attackers, though she tends to prefer one-on-one combat where her precision and reading ability reach peak effectiveness.

Her offensive philosophy emphasizes inevitability through refinement. Rather than overwhelming opponents with volume, she applies mounting technical pressure until a critical opening appears. Once identified, she executes high-speed, deeply committed thrust sequences capable of concluding engagements instantly. Her finishing strikes often combine magical acceleration with spatial compression, producing attacks that appear deceptively simple but carry catastrophic penetrative force.

BLADE GUILLOTINE’s fighting doctrine can be summarized as **exaltation through contest**. She does not seek destruction for its own sake, but rather pursues combat as a medium of discovery and self-definition. Her battlefield presence represents the pursuit of excellence through confrontation, making her an opponent who is as eager to be challenged as she is dangerous to face.

> *"Threats only work on people with something to lose."*

Mahana Sahi is a central member of **[[Heart Melody]]** and the second leader of the team following the death of Pyara Dana. She transforms into **[[Heart Symphony]]** and later ascends through increasingly complex harmonic states of Lúmenai, increasing to **[[Heart Crescendo]]** and culminating in **[[Finalis Grande]]**. Mahana embodies escalation, endurance, and the burden of carrying a harmony that was never meant to be singular.

## History

### Bio

Mahana Sahi is gentle, cheerful, and profoundly powerful, despite having little confidence in herself. She is easily deceived and painfully naive, yet her kindness is unwavering. Mahana bears a striking resemblance to Pyara and suffers from severe memory loss, a coincidence that deeply unsettles Kali.

Despite her uncertainty, Mahana never gives up. She stumbles, fails, and gets back up smiling every time.

As Heart Symphony, Mahana inherits leadership after Pyara’s death. Her fighting style is direct and overwhelming, fueled by raw magical output rather than finesse. She fights to honor what was lost, striving to prove herself worthy of the role she never asked for.

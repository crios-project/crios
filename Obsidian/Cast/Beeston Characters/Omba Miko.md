## History

### Bio

Omba Miko is precise, composed, and intensely professional. In stark contrast to her twin, she prefers structure and planning over improvisation. Omba approaches problems analytically, often identifying flaws and contingencies others overlook.

A technological prodigy, Omba designed much of the Lovely Hearts’ communications and tactical infrastructure. She is known for her bluntness and meticulous attention to detail—even tracking her age in half-years.

As Heart Verismo, Omba functions as the team’s tactical mind. While Aria decides what the team will do, Verismo determines how. Her magic emphasizes foresight, coordination, and battlefield control. Omba fights not for glory, but to ensure a future exists at all.

## History

### Bio

Pyara Dana is the emotional heart and original leader of the Lovely Hearts. Bright, optimistic, and seemingly unshakable, Pyara approaches life with the firm belief that things will work out simply because they must. Her carefree demeanor masks an immense well of natural magical power, much of which she wields instinctively rather than through conscious control.

Pyara’s unwavering trust in others—especially her older sister Kali—defines her relationships. She inspires loyalty not through command, but through joy. To Pyara, protecting her friends is as natural as breathing, and she never considers the possibility of failure.

As [[Heart Aria]], Pyara fights with radiant confidence, smiling even in the face of overwhelming odds. Her magic responds to emotion as much as intent, making her abilities unpredictable but potent. Pyara fights not to defeat enemies, but to ensure her friends make it home together.

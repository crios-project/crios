> *"This is going to be so much fun."*

**Aran Letale** is a core combatant of **[[Heart Melody]]** and the bearer of the magical identity **[[Heart Sonata]]**. Within the team, Aran represents precision, restraint, and controlled force. Where others channel emotion outward, Aran condenses intent into sharp, decisive action through **Férroma**, the [[Metal]] entwinement.

## Physical Description

- **Height:** 4 ft 11 in (150 cm) →  5 ft 1 in (155 cm)

- **Attire / Equipment:** Practical civilian clothing; armored, blade-accented attire as Heart Sonata

Aran’s civilian appearance is compact and unassuming, but her posture and gaze suggest constant evaluation. As **Heart Sonata**, her design shifts sharply: angular silhouettes, metallic accents, and restrained ornamentation. Unlike the flowing designs of other Hearts, Sonata’s aesthetic is rigid and weapon-forward, visually reinforcing her role as the team’s edge.

## History

### Bio
Aran functions as Heart Melody’s executioner—rarely the first to act, but often the one who ends a conflict.

### Backstory / Origin
Raised in an environment that rewarded discipline over expression, Aran learned early to compress emotion into action. Lúmenai responded not to her feelings, but to her control of them.

### Formative Events
- Awakening as **Heart Sonata**
- The death of **Pyara Dana**, which destabilized her belief that control alone can prevent loss

### Family / Lineage
Unremarkable; no known notable lineage.

### Cultural Background
Beestonian; shaped by structured emotional resonance.

### Education / Training
Self-directed combat training; repetitive, perfection-driven practice.

### Past Affiliations
None prior to Heart Melody.

### Secrets / Hidden History
Aran fears that without rigid control, her power would become indiscriminate.

### Reputation
Seen as intimidating, reliable, and emotionally distant.

## History

### Bio

Kali Dana is serious, vigilant, and perpetually worried—especially when it comes to her younger sister. Orphaned young, Kali built her entire identity around keeping Pyara safe, often at the expense of her own well-being. She is pragmatic, disciplined, and far more perceptive than she lets on.

Even outside of her magical role, Kali is dangerous: a skilled knife fighter who wields twin daggers with lethal precision. Where Pyara trusts easily, Kali questions everything.

As [[Heart Seria]], Kali serves as the Lovely Hearts’ defensive backbone. She positions herself between danger and her teammates, prioritizing Pyara’s safety above all else. Her magic emphasizes protection, barriers, and countermeasures. If the team must fall, Kali intends to be the last one standing.

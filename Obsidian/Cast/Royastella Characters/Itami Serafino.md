- Overly sensitive

While these impressions are partially accurate, they are often misunderstood. Itami’s emotional expression is not instability but transparency. Her feelings manifest visibly and immediately, allowing audiences to interpret her reactions as genuine and deeply human.

### Runic Identity

Unknown to the public, Itami is the commanding leader of [[Starlite 7th]] and one of the highest-ranking Runic Knights operating within Royastella.

She wields the **Auroral Throneblade**, the most powerful weapon within the Runic Knight arsenal.

#### Auroral Throneblade Capabilities
- Massive two-handed greatblade optimized for sweeping battlefield control
- Generates **Blade Beam**, a crescent-shaped energy projection

### Starlight Blessing — Future Sight

**Function:**  
Allows Itami to perceive ten seconds into the future.

**Limitations:**  
- Fixed ten-second foresight window  
- Ten-second cooldown following each activation  

#### Tactical Implications

Future Sight provides Itami with unparalleled micro-temporal battlefield awareness. Rather than functioning as magic, Starlight Blessings operate as System-granted skill protocols within Royastella’s universal progression framework. The System itself is widely regarded as benevolent and stabilizing rather than manipulative or adversarial.

In combat, Future Sight enables:
- Instant counter-response to surprise attacks  
- Preemptive targeting and positioning  
- Near-perfect defensive timing  
- Predictive team coordination  

Itami often appears to react before events occur, reinforcing her reputation as a battlefield sovereign.

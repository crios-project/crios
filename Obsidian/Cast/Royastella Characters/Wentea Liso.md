### Overview

Wentea Liso exists as one of the most publicly visible yet personally unknowable members of [[Starlite 7th]]. She is internationally recognized as a fashion icon, commercial brand architect, and cultural trendsetter, yet almost no verifiable biographical data exists regarding her origins, family, or early life.

Behind the manufactured public identity lies a paradoxical individual whose outward composure disguises profound absent-mindedness and wandering focus. However, when assuming her Runic mantle as the **Starlit Dynast**, that scattered disposition condenses into one of the most precise and relentless combat minds among the Runic Knights.

### Civilian Identity

Publicly, Wentea operates as an elite fashion model and founder of a globally successful clothing line.

#### Public Persona
Wentea is widely perceived as:
- Impossibly calm  
- Elegantly reserved  
- Emotionally balanced  
- Effortlessly sophisticated  

Her reputation is heavily curated by an extraordinarily effective management and protection network. This network has successfully maintained the illusion of deliberate, refined composure while concealing her genuine tendencies toward distraction and abstract thinking.

#### Private Reality
Wentea is notably:
- Highly absent-minded  
- Prone to drifting attention  
- Socially aloof even among allies  
- Surprisingly unstructured in personal habits  

Despite her massive global recognition, verified information about her past remains scarce. Known facts are limited to:
- She originates from foreign territories  
- Her family remains there, with whom she has lost contact  
- Her public identity may not reflect her original name or history  

Her handlers maintain an unprecedented level of narrative control over her public presence.

### Runic Identity

As the **Starlit Dynast**, Wentea undergoes a near-total personality inversion.

The distracted, floating demeanor is replaced with:
- Hyper-focused tactical awareness  
- Relentless offensive momentum  
- Controlled emotional intensity  
- Absolute battlefield clarity  

Dynast is widely regarded as the most psychologically immovable member of the team. Situations that would overwhelm or destabilize other Runic Knights frequently serve as conditions in which she excels.

### Weapon — Celestial Regnant

A Runic vajra designed for overwhelming, sustained offensive assault.

#### Capabilities
- Functions as both piercing and crushing instrument  
- Channels rotational momentum into cascading multi-strike sequences  
- Amplifies velocity-based combat styles  
- Generates localized storm-like impact patterns during high-speed maneuvering  

When combined with Dynast’s mobility, Celestial Regnant transforms her into a continuous vortex of destructive force capable of dismantling entire enemy formations through rotational strike patterns.

### Starlight Blessing — Super Speed

**Function:**  
Grants extreme acceleration in both physical movement and cognitive processing.

#### Physical Effects
- Movement velocity far exceeding standard Runic limits  
- Rapid strike chaining with negligible recovery windows  
- Near-instantaneous repositioning across combat zones  

#### Cognitive Effects
- Overclocked neural processing  
- Perceptual dilation that produces the sensation of slowed external time  
- Real-time tactical recalibration mid-combat  

This dual enhancement allows Dynast to operate as both an executioner and battlefield analyst simultaneously. Opponents often perceive her attacks as unavoidable due to the absence of traditional reaction windows.

As with all Starlight Blessings, Super Speed is a System-granted ability rather than magical invocation. The Royastellan System is widely regarded as a benevolent and stabilizing force.

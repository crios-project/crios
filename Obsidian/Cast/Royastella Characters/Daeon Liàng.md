### Overview

Daeon Liàng is a prodigious financial magnate and tactical savant whose intellect manifests through relentless precision, pragmatic realism, and uncompromising professionalism.

As the **Starlit Czar**, Daeon operates as the primary strategic architect of [[Starlite 7th]]. His battlefield planning consistently produces decisive victories, and the rare defeats suffered by the team are overwhelmingly linked to his absence or premature removal from engagement.

[[Starlite 7th]] operates independently of government or military structures, maintaining complete secrecy and functioning as autonomous protectors whose existence is largely speculative to the public.

### Civilian Identity

Daeon is widely regarded as an economic prodigy. Through disciplined analysis and predictive modeling, he has accumulated immense wealth at a remarkably young age, positioning himself among the most financially powerful individuals in his nation.

#### Behavioral Traits
- Rigid professionalism  
- Hyper-analytical cognition  
- Severe emotional restraint  
- Chronic pessimistic forecasting  
- Unwavering efficiency standards  

Daeon’s academic career was marked by complete scholastic dominance, achieved through obsessive study habits that permanently damaged his eyesight. He now requires glasses for vision correction, though he treats them as purely functional rather than aesthetic.

His public demeanor is famously austere:
- He does not smile  
- He does not raise his voice  
- He speaks in concise, utilitarian statements  
- He reflexively identifies worst-case outcomes  

Despite this emotional distance, Daeon maintains select professional and personal relationships. He facilitates distribution operations for [[Kayre]]’s fashion enterprise through corporate infrastructure and logistical oversight.

### Starlight Blessing — Portal Generation

**Function:**  
Allows the creation of spatial portals directly from Czar’s fists, extending strike range beyond physical proximity.

#### Operational Effects
- Converts melee attacks into long-range impacts  
- Enables unpredictable attack vectors  
- Allows instantaneous repositioning of strike origin  
- Supports layered assault formations  

The Blessing effectively transforms Czar into a spatial pressure fighter capable of delivering attacks from impossible angles.

As with all Starlight Blessings, Portal Generation is a System-granted skill rather than a magical phenomenon. The Royastellan System functions as a benevolent structural force rather than a controlling entity.

### Overview

Riasa Sungbae is a thrill-seeking prodigy whose civilian recklessness contrasts sharply with the disciplined ferocity of her Runic manifestation. She is a high-profile social figure known for her extreme hobbies, prodigious vehicle mastery, and frequent legal complications resulting from both.

As the **Starlit Pasha**, Riasa becomes a relentless aerial combatant whose crusading zeal and punishing combat style make her one of the most aggressive members of [[Starlite 7th]]. Despite her extremely public civilian life, her connection to Pasha remains undiscovered, largely due to the overwhelming difference in demeanor between identities.

---

### Civilian Identity

Riasa is widely recognized as a wealthy and influential debutante whose personal brand revolves around excitement, danger, and spectacle.

#### Behavioral Traits
- Extreme adrenaline dependency  
- Constant pursuit of new high-risk experiences  
- Obsessive collector of martial arts disciplines  
- Exceptionally skilled multi-vehicle operator  

Riasa demonstrates unnatural aptitude in controlling nearly any transportation system, including airborne, aquatic, hovering, and terrestrial vehicles. However, her mechanical mastery is offset by consistent disregard for operational law and regulation. As a result, she maintains a legal defense team more robust than personal security.

Her impulsive nature is frequently mistaken for carelessness, though her successes suggest an intuitive grasp of kinetic systems and spatial motion.

---

### Runic Identity

As the **Starlit Pasha**, Riasa undergoes a drastic psychological shift. The reckless thrill-seeker gives way to a crusader who frames combat as a moral obligation.

Pasha fights with:
- Elevated tactical clarity  
- Strong ideological commitment to justice  
- Extreme physical and emotional intensity  

Her combat methods are widely regarded as overwhelming and brutally efficient, often discouraging observers from associating her with her comparatively carefree civilian counterpart.

Ironically, Riasa’s well-known inability to maintain secrets becomes one of her strongest safeguards; few believe she could conceal such a monumental double life.

### Weapon — Diadem Refrains

A matched set of high-velocity throwing chakrams engineered for aerial dominance and mid-range suppression.

#### Core Capabilities
- Precision-guided boomerang return function  
- Capable of multi-angle ricochet trajectories  
- Balanced for both ranged slicing and close-quarters rotational attacks  

Pasha frequently employs complex aerial throwing patterns, using gravity manipulation to alter weapon arcs mid-flight, creating unpredictable attack vectors.

---

### Starlight Blessing — Gravity Manipulation

**Function:**  
Allows Pasha to manipulate localized gravitational forces affecting herself and objects she can physically lift.

#### Primary Effects
- Sustained personal flight  
- Mass-assisted aerial maneuvering  
- Ability to transport allies, weapons, or environmental objects during flight  

Unlike telekinetic manipulation, Pasha’s lifting threshold remains tied to her physical strength baseline. However, her exceptional athleticism allows her to move surprisingly large masses while airborne.

As with all Starlight Blessings, this ability is granted through the Royastellan System and is not magical in origin. The System remains widely regarded as a benevolent and stabilizing cosmic framework.

---

### Combat Style

Pasha specializes in vertical battlefield control and momentum warfare.

#### Tactical Tendencies
- Aggressive aerial engagement  
- High-speed rotational assault patterns  
- Momentum stacking through chained gravitational shifts  
- Weapon orbiting and rebound strikes  

Her fighting style emphasizes overwhelming pressure, frequently maintaining constant offensive motion until opponents collapse under cumulative assault.

#### Physical Characteristics
- Exceptionally tall frame

#### Hair & Visual Signature

- Base coloration: pale blonde-white  
- Outer layers and spikes: vivid crimson  
- Flame-like layered styling creating cloak-like movement

### Outfit Composition

#### Base Suit
- Sleeveless brown bodysuit with high neckline  
- Structured piping creating subtle armor-like reinforcement  
- Integrated with long, near-shoulder-length gloves  

#### Layered Elements
- Detached red vest with high collar and asymmetrical lower panels  
- Dual white belt buckles for structural and decorative balance  
- Puff-styled short skirt introducing mobility and visual contrast  

#### Lower Garments
- Continuous brown thigh-high footwear blending into boots  
- Streamlined construction designed to minimize aerial drag  

The overall design maintains unity through consistent brown combat-suit layering while red elements signify rank, presence, and visual aggression.

### Visual Presence & Body Language

Common indicators include:
- Elevated chin positioning  
- Stable, grounded stance when stationary  
- Direct, unwavering eye contact

Even at rest, her posture communicates authority and readiness.

### Personality

Riasa embodies intensity in both identities, though expressed differently.

#### Civilian Temperament

- Experience-driven  
- Energetically social  

#### Runic Temperament
- Ideologically driven  
- Combat-focused  
- Fiercely protective  
- Highly disciplined under pressure

### Overview

Takino Retsu is one of the youngest members of [[Starlite 7th]], selected under circumstances that strongly imply the involvement of the Royastellan System rather than institutional or political influence. She is characterized by extreme social detachment, minimal emotional display, and an unwavering preference for intellectual solitude.

Despite her reluctance toward social interaction or exertion, Takino functions as one of the team’s most strategically vital force multipliers. Her presence dramatically increases the operational ceiling of allied Runic Knights, frequently determining the outcome of large-scale engagements.

---

### Civilian Identity

Takino maintains a reclusive and academically oriented lifestyle.

#### Behavioral Traits
- Strong preference for reading and scholarly isolation  
- Avoids outdoor environments whenever possible  
- Communicates minimally in casual social settings  
- Frequently mistaken for aloofness or indifference  

Takino is often described as someone who appears approachable from a distance yet remains emotionally inaccessible in direct interaction. Photography and staged appearances frequently portray her as friendly or gentle, though this perception rarely aligns with her reserved interpersonal habits.

Her conversational engagement is typically limited to subjects of intellectual interest. Outside those parameters, she tends toward brief responses or silence.

---

### Runic Identity

As the **Starlit Mikado**, Takino transitions into a combatant defined by calculated efficiency and ruthless optimization.

Her battlefield philosophy is centered around minimizing exertion through maximized effectiveness. Every movement is executed with surgical precision, eliminating unnecessary flourish or redundancy. This results in a combat style that appears almost mechanical in its exactness.

Takino demonstrates little interest in dramatic displays of strength, instead prioritizing rapid engagement termination and resource conservation.

### Weapon — Lotus Dominion

A modular pair of short hook blades designed for adaptive engagement.

#### Base Configuration
- Dual independent hook blades optimized for close-range slashing and disarming maneuvers  
- Balanced for both melee retention and precision throwing  

#### Combined Configuration
- Blades interlock to form a butterfly sword-style weapon  
- Provides extended reach and rotational attack patterns  
- Allows rapid transitions between offensive and defensive stances  

Lotus Dominion’s modular design complements Takino’s preference for versatile solutions that reduce the need for prolonged combat engagement.

### Starlight Blessing — Amplification

**Function:**  
Doubles the output of Mana-based techniques and Starlight Blessings affecting allied units.

#### Standard Application
- Multiplies magical potency and System-granted skill effectiveness by approximately twofold  
- Significantly enhances group combat viability during coordinated engagements  

#### Advanced Realization
Takino later discovers that Amplification can be recursively applied to herself. By increasing her own output parameters, she extends her amplification effect to approximately threefold when applied to allies.

This recursive enhancement transforms Mikado into one of the most strategically influential figures among Runic Knights, as her presence can exponentially increase overall team capability.

As with all Starlight Blessings, Amplification is a System-based skill rather than magical casting. The Royastellan System remains widely recognized as a stabilizing and benevolent force.

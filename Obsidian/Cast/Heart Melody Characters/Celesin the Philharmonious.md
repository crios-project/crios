## Appearance

Celesin manifests as a radiant fairy construct composed of living musical notation and harmonic sigils. Her body resembles a ceremonial lyre formed from luminous stave lines and elegant clef-like flourishes. At her center rests a crystalline heart that pulses in time with emotional resonance.

Her upper form bears a halo resembling a suspended whole note, symbolizing her role as an overseer of melodic balance. Decorative scrollwork radiates outward like wings, while her lower body transitions into layered heart and bloom motifs reminiscent of both lotus petals and harmonic vibration waves.

Her coloration consists primarily of lavender, rose quartz pink, and pearl white, tones traditionally associated with empathy, emotional clarity, and unity magic.

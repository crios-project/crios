 ![[Heart Beat.png|225]]
Heart Beat represents an ascended combat state derived from [[Heart Aria]], maintaining the same foundational philosophy of perseverance, emotional resilience, and unwavering optimism while dramatically amplifying combat potency, magical throughput, and battlefield authority. When wielding the ascension artifact sword **Coralas**, Aria transitions into Beat, gaining expanded access to Tier 2 Lúmenai manifestation and significantly enhanced physical and magical synchronization.

Heart Beat’s fighting methodology mirrors Aria’s fluid, instinct-driven engagement style but operates at a substantially elevated tempo and intensity. Her movements retain the expressive, flowing structure characteristic of Aria’s combat rhythm, yet they become sharper, faster, and more assertive. Beat favors sustained forward pressure combined with wide-reaching, sweeping strike arcs that allow her to control engagement space while maintaining constant offensive momentum.

The ascension artifact **Coralas** serves as both weapon and transformation catalyst. Unlike Aria’s claw-based grappling and slashing emphasis with *Serrata Glissando*, Coralas introduces extended reach, heavier strike authority, and refined energy projection capability. Beat utilizes the blade for broad, resonant slashes, spiraling cut patterns, and radiant projection waves that allow her to strike multiple targets simultaneously or disrupt enemy formations from mid-range. The weapon naturally amplifies her emotional and magical resonance, translating her unwavering determination directly into raw combat output.

Heart Beat demonstrates stable and highly efficient use of Tier 2 Lúmenai manifestation, allowing her to layer elemental constructs, defensive barriers, and amplified attack manifestations without the cognitive delay normally associated with higher-tier casting. Similar to Aria, much of Beat’s magic usage occurs subconsciously, flowing seamlessly into her physical attack chains. She frequently merges magical bursts into sword strikes, producing cascading follow-through effects that maintain offensive continuity and overwhelm defensive recovery attempts.

Her movement style emphasizes relentless forward progression supported by magical reinforcement. Beat employs airborne redirection, sweeping spin recoveries, and forward momentum chaining that allows her to maintain battlefield presence even while evading counterattacks. She rarely yields positional control once established, instead converting defensive reactions into immediate counteroffensive transitions.

Rhythmically, Heart Beat’s combat presence resembles a triumphant orchestral expansion—maintaining Aria’s uplifting cadence but expressed through stronger, more resonant tempo surges. She often escalates engagements through progressive attack layering, beginning with sweeping area control strikes before accelerating into rapid, multi-directional sword chains enhanced by magical detonation pulses.

Psychologically, Heart Beat embodies Aria’s refusal to surrender or succumb to despair, elevated into a symbol of inspirational resilience. Her presence on the battlefield often boosts allied morale and stabilizes team cohesion through emotional and magical resonance alike. She fights with visible joy and unwavering confidence, projecting reassurance to allies even during overwhelming combat scenarios.

Despite the substantial increase in combat capability, Beat retains Aria’s instinctive and emotionally driven decision-making process. While this allows for extraordinary improvisation and adaptability, it occasionally results in risk-heavy engagement patterns, particularly when protecting allies or attempting to recover endangered teammates. However, Coralas’ ascension harmonization provides enhanced durability and energy regulation, allowing her to sustain high-intensity combat far longer than her base form.

Heart Beat excels as a frontline momentum commander and inspirational vanguard. She is especially effective in prolonged engagements where sustained magical reinforcement and emotional cohesion determine battlefield endurance. Her ability to maintain pressure while simultaneously uplifting allied combat effectiveness makes her a central stabilizing force during high-threat encounters.

Heart Beat’s guiding principle is **hope elevated into power**. Through Coralas, Tier 2 Lúmenai mastery, and the ascended expression of Aria’s unbreakable spirit, she transforms perseverance into radiant strength—fighting not only to win battles, but to ensure that no ally ever faces despair alone.

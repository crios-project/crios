### Overview

Praxis Verax Affinas (PVA) was an experimental inter-realm exploration organization founded within Nexsicon. The group’s central objective was to validate the controversial [[Lodesoul Theorem]], which proposed that realities possess hierarchical metaphysical density known as Ontological Depth, and that these realities can be integrated under specific narrative and magical conditions.

Originally conceived as a scientific and exploratory initiative, PVA gradually evolved into an active realm-integration task force. Their operations resulted in Nexsicon absorbing multiple smaller dimensional constructs, significantly increasing its metaphysical stability and scale.

Despite its early successes, the organization ultimately collapsed following a catastrophic causality rupture known as the Cascade Resonance, which fragmented alliances, destabilized reality structures, and triggered internal ideological division.

---
### Foundational Purpose

PVA existed to:

- Validate the existence of multiple realms
- Prove the legitimacy of Lodesoul Theory, originally developed by Tiala’s disgraced father
- Study and manipulate Ontological Depth relationships
- Facilitate controlled integration of weaker or unstable realms into Nexsicon
- Establish safe cross-realm navigation and magical identity stabilization systems

While initially framed as academic and preservationist, their work gradually shifted toward large-scale metaphysical intervention.

---
### Organizational Structure

PVA functioned as a collaborative research unit rather than a rigid command hierarchy. Leadership influence generally centered around Tiala due to her role as founder and principal theorist.
#### Core Members

- [[Tiala Corsolis]] — Founder / Principal Lodesoul Researcher
- [[Jí Lián Xiá]] (later operating as [[Kesshō Kawa]])— Strategic Stabilizer / Operational Safety Oversight
- [[Claris Quies]] (later operating as [[Tessera Iustum]]) — Realm Reconnaissance Specialist
- [[Ami Hartbreak]] (later operating as [[Amaranthine Breaklight]]) — Chaos Disruption & Experimental Field Testing
- [[Xīwàng Tiānshàng]] — Moral Counterbalance / Tactical Enforcement
- [[Fú cì Ánguāng]] (later operating as [[Zhòu-chún Shìfàng]])— Auxiliary Field Companion / Emotional Support Presence

---
### Formation & Recruitment Motivations

#### Tiala

Formed PVA to vindicate her father’s scientific legacy and demonstrate the empirical reality of cross-dimensional existence.

#### Jí Lián

Joined preemptively, recognizing Tiala’s tendency toward reckless experimentation and believing her presence would prevent catastrophic outcomes.

#### Claris

Sought clues regarding her missing elder sister through inter-realm exploration.
#### Ami 

Joined largely out of loyalty to Claris and personal amusement regarding interdimensional experimentation.
#### Xīwàng

Participated to support her closest allies while quietly investigating opportunities to dismantle the Tiānshàng family power structure.

#### Fú cì 

Accompanied her sister Xīwàng, functioning primarily as emotional support and observational participant. Assists in combat when she gains the Zhòu-chún Shìfàng transformation.

### Operational Achievements

PVA accomplished several unprecedented feats:

- Successful integration of multiple minor realms into Nexsicon
- Stabilization of cross-realm travel corridors
- Development of Magical Persona Partitioning, allowing members to operate openly while preserving civilian identity integrity
- Early refinement of inter-realm magical girl transformation frameworks
- Ontological Depth amplification of Nexsicon through controlled realm absorption

---
### Magical Persona Framework

PVA pioneered the concept of Persona Partitioning, allowing members to:

- Maintain separate heroic and civilian identities
- Operate publicly without exposing personal existence continuity
- Adapt magical constructs to different realm physics

This innovation later influenced magical infrastructures in both Beeston and Royastella.

---
### Cross-Realm Deployment

PVA members eventually distributed themselves across realities to expand research coverage:

- [[Claris Quies]] and [[Ami Hartbreak]] established extended operational presence in Beeston
- [[Jí Lián Xiá]] conducted research and stabilization activities in Royastella
- [[Tiala Corsolis]] moved between realms, performing direct Lodesoul provocation experiments

---
### The Antagonist Methodology

To reveal and stimulate Lodesoul manifestations, Tiala adopted antagonist identities across different realms:

- [[dissonant discord]] — Harmonic destabilization entity operating in Beeston
- [[BLADE GUILLOTINE]] — Catastrophic execution archetype operating in Royastella
  
These identities were deliberately constructed as existential threats designed to force Lodesoul activation and measurable metaphysical response.

---
### The Grand Magic Catastrophe

Following successful identification of Lodesoul presence across multiple realms, Tiala attempted to forcibly accelerate universal entropy convergence through an unassisted Grand Magic designed to merge all realities into the realm with the highest Ontological Depth.

The spell succeeded in partially destabilizing dimensional boundaries but produced unintended consequences:
#### Cascade Resonance

- Narrative probability failures across multiple realities
- Cross-realm entity displacement
- Spontaneous emergence of historically impossible events
- Accelerated metaphysical entropy
- Breakdown of causal continuity

---
### Organizational Collapse

The [[Cascade Resonance]] triggered several irreversible events:

- The unexplained disappearance of [[Xīwàng Tiānshàng]]
- Escalating emotional and ideological conflict among members
- Increased instability across operational realms
- Loss of centralized leadership coherence

During this crisis, tensions between the Dana sisters escalated beyond reconciliation, culminating in:

- Ami abandoning PVA
- Tiala restructuring remaining members into Destiny’s Penance
- Ami forming Reason Theory in ideological opposition

These events marked the effective dissolution of Praxis Verax Affinas.

---
### Legacy

Despite its collapse, PVA fundamentally reshaped cross-realm metaphysics. Their work:

- Validated Ontological Depth as a measurable phenomenon
- Established foundational cross-realm transformation theory
- Triggered multiple modern magical faction formations
- Introduced long-term instability into inter-reality causality

Many current interdimensional crises trace their origin directly to PVA experimentation.

---
### Symbolism

Praxis Verax Affinas represents:

- The danger of knowledge pursued without restraint
- Scientific ambition colliding with emotional consequence
- The fragility of friendship under cosmic-scale responsibility
- The ethical ambiguity of salvation through destruction

---
### Narrative Themes

- Whether truth justifies catastrophic risk
- The consequences of rewriting reality for ideological validation
- The cost of progress driven by unresolved grief and legacy pressure
- The divergence between protection and control

---
### Trivia (Out-of-Universe)

- The organization name translates loosely to “Truth Through Applied Action” in stylized hybrid Latin.
- PVA functions narratively as the catalytic origin point for multiple faction conflicts and reality fractures across the setting.
- The group’s dissolution intentionally mirrors the collapse of experimental scientific consortiums that exceed ethical oversight.

# I. Cosmology & Metaphysics

## Multiversal Structure

Crios operates across multiple interlinked realities referred to as **Realms**. These realms possess independent ontological stability but can interact or merge under certain metaphysical pressures.

### Confirmed Realms

- **Nexsicon** — Convergence realm and scientific/magical research nexus.
- **Royastella** — Element Core magic and harmonic structure system.
- **Beeston** — Essentia-based magic system.
- Additional mythic realms manifest during convergence events.

---
## Ontological Depth

Each realm possesses a measurable metaphysical “weight” determining stability and gravitational pull during realm mergers.

Higher Ontological Depth =  
Greater capacity to absorb or anchor merging realities.

---
# II. Core Metaphysical Theories

---
## The Lodesoul Theorem

### Definition

A **Lodesoul** is a being whose existence anchors narrative, metaphysical, and existential continuity of a realm.

### Effects of Lodesouls

- Realities bend around them.
- Their removal destabilizes universal coherence.
- Their destruction causes regeneration or transference.

---
### Nexsican Counter-Theory

Lodesouls are **conduits rather than anchors**.

Observed Properties:

1. Removing a Lodesoul does not immediately destroy a realm.
2. Moving a Lodesoul causes realms to gravitationally converge.
3. Destroying a Lodesoul results in rebirth or displacement.

---
### Verified Experimental Incident

A Nexsican scientist’s daughter summoned a Lodesoul from a non-magical realm, causing realm merging and mythic land manifestation.

Research was later banned.  
Scientist disappeared.

---
## Realm Convergence

The gradual or forced merging of realities.

### Effects

- Cultural blending
- Geographic rewriting
- Mythical civilizations re-manifest
- Magic system interaction and hybridization
- Increased metaphysical instability

---
# III. Major Catastrophic Event

---
## Cascade Resonance — The Grand Magic Catastrophe

### Cause

[[Tiala Hartlight]] attempted a **Grand Magic entropy acceleration spell** to force universal convergence into the deepest realm.

### Result

Spell partially succeeded and triggered:

- Probability collapse across realities
- Entity displacement between realms
- Manifestation of impossible historical events
- Breakdown of causality
- Emotional and ideological fractures in factions

---

### Known Direct Consequences

- Disappearance of [[Xīwàng Tiānshàng]]   
- Collapse of Praxis Verax Affinas
- Creation of Destiny’s Penance
- Creation of Reason Theory
- Increased cross-realm instability

# V. The Akashic Record (Crios Interpretation)

---
## Mythic Foundation

A universal archive containing all knowledge, past, present, and potential futures.

5. Quantify resonance using Cymora.
6. Filter resonance through Royastellan Element Cores.
7. Create a path into the Akashic Record.

### Purpose

To identify and prepare against future existential threats including:

- Extra-dimensional invaders
- Alien forces
- Demonic entities
- Yokai
- Ghost and spiritual invasions

# X. Key Concepts

---

## Harmonic Identity

Each individual possesses a metaphysical melody representing existence.

Disruption results in:

- Identity fracture
- Reality displacement
- Timeline desynchronization

---

## Desync Strike

Advanced Ómura technique used by discord:

- Removes individuals from their native harmonic reality.
- Does not kill — displaces existential continuity.    

---

# XI. Themes Across Crios

- Destiny vs agency
- Emotional resonance as power
- Existential continuity
- The morality of inevitability
- Identity fragmentation across realities
- The cost of knowledge and foresight

---

# XII. Outstanding Canon Ambiguities

(Deliberately unresolved)
    
- Nature of extra-dimensional threats.
- Final state of universal convergence.
- Limits of Tier 5 Æónel magic.
